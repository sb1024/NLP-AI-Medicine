"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,9858108,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,17591,685608202,-0.005881147375410165
"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment paradigms based on the diagnostic output.",Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis,10066656,F30HD102120,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cauterize', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Coupled', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Endocrine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Microbiology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Shunt Device', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Survivors', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Uganda', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'genome sequencing', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'neurosurgery', 'non-invasive imaging', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septic', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,F30,2020,32183,68045551,-0.007573239344560096
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9989634,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,38064,641965656,-0.016647611920680563
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,533302350,0.006011091821788845
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,324592664,-0.0009750226865639704
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients.

"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,9992378,F31LM013403,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Ethnography', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policy Maker', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Service provision', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'court', 'deep learning', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'social', 'social bias', 'social inequality', 'symposium', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,50520,593605914,-0.0024579905503194777
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,2966077,-0.013960470049408227
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,111231681,-0.008317243792348512
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,254622553,-0.006082700972705527
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,533302350,-0.0073480297017201185
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,570146095,0.008447774336927588
"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings.

"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112401,224803,0.01188117963507488
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,5678328,-0.0050608574128524625
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,37281765,-0.002555911042986777
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,232986943,-0.010907370056697056
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models Project Summary/Abstract The number of practicing pathologists around the world is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next two decades, with some of the world’s poorest countries having a ratio of only one pathologist to many hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, the diagnostic caseload that requires their expertise in clinical trials and hospital settings will continue to grow. The digitization of pathology data, coupled with the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing and scoring the data, provides exciting opportunities to make the field of pathology more efficient and scalable, even as the workforce continues to evolve. Deep learning in particular provides the potential to enhance the interpretation of medical images by improving the detection of image-based biomarkers for a broad range of diseases. Image interpretation plays an important role in patient eligibility and endpoint determination during the course of clinical trials. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the development of trained and reliable algorithms that can help pathologists identify disease progression and response to treatment in a timely and effective manner can provide benefit in two important ways. First, it will help to ensure that the most appropriate score for histological disease severity is being assigned to each image using the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) or similar grading scale. Second, it will support a triage process by which images known to contain non- healthy tissues can be prioritized for earlier assessment. Through a unique partnership between Azavea, a geospatial technology and machine learning firm, and Robarts, a clinical trials organization, the proposed research will begin to address these needs by developing deep learning algorithms for histopathology digital image analysis, testing them on machine-readable annotations of medical imagery from previous clinical studies, and exposing them through a metadata- searchable interface that will enable the images to be categorized and quickly accessed by pathologists and others to support reader training and increase communication between multiple readers and sites. In so doing, it will not only help streamline the evaluation of new ulcerative colitis treatments that rely heavily on the image interpretation process, but also provide the foundation for the identification of additional components present in other gastrointestinal disease indications in the future. Project Narrative The proposed research will contribute critical new insights on the reliability, sensitivity, and practicality of machine learning to support gastrointestinal disease detection and evaluation in a clinical trials setting. In pathology, where manual interpretation of images using a microscope has remained relatively unchanged for decades, machine learning provides particular potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses by reducing the subjectivity that is often inherent in the process.",Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models,10081185,R43EB030441,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endoscopy', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Software Design', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'prototype', 'software development', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,"AZAVEA, INC",R43,2020,150000,150000,-0.01770380011975595
"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE,10124937,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,150000,533594881,-0.0016960804113105262
"Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis Project Summary/Abstract This supplement will address the unintended consequences and collateral damage that arise when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age. In this aim, we examine our existing database for evidence of bias based on self-reported race, sex or age. We further determine the extent to which these variables influence classification performance. To the extent sample sizes allow, we will carry this analysis to the level of specific syndromes. Finally, we will use anonymized reference datasets of non-syndromic faces to compare false positive rates based on NIH race definitions, sex and age. The outcome of this aim is to objectively establish bias and estimate the effects of under-representation across race, age and sex categories within our data. In Aim 2, we will determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians. This aim will establish the extent to which the storing of large databases of facial images and the application of machine learning processes to them for diagnostic purposes may raise privacy concerns. The concerns investigated will include potential hacks into protected health information; fear relating to the bias in some facial recognition software (and, potentially, in the Facebase database); and fear of discrimination in the application of the technology, such as by insurers. The outcome will be a white paper that targets a high-profile journal, summarizing the findings and defining crucial issues that should guide the development of facial imaging for disease diagnosis and clinical usage. Project Narrative Our supplement application will address the important question of unintended consequences and collateral damage when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. The use of large facial recognition databases in medicine represents a frontier that arrives with tremendous potential but undeniable risks. Our central aims are: (1) determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age; and (2) determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians.",Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis,10132648,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Authoritarianism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient imaging', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Race', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'disease diagnosis', 'facial recognition software', 'frontier', 'human data', 'intervention cost', 'new technology', 'professor', 'repository', 'sex', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,152200,324592664,-0.007801464866658727
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9899862,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'advanced analytics', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke risk', 'stroke therapy', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,163080,228951281,-0.018322418030964877
"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,9952647,K08HL151907,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alabama', 'Antibiotics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mucosal Immune Responses', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pediatrics', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career development', 'critical developmental period', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fungus', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-lung axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'lung development', 'lung injury', 'member', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'new therapeutic target', 'pneumonia model', 'pre-clinical', 'prenatal', 'preterm newborn', 'professor', 'protective effect', 'pulmonary function', 'research and development', 'respiratory microbiome', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'translational research program', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K08,2020,165456,325573502,-0.04346434584403187
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,146629556,-0.00886682584517782
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,593605914,-0.00601195223696664
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians. By incorporating artificial intelligence and social networking into a FHx tool, it will lead to greater engagement with FHx collection. This research study will identify and incorporate features that promote user adoption, and evaluate its impact on FHx collection.  ",Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence,10008996,K07CA211786,"['Adoption', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Family', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Genomic medicine', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population', 'Social Network', 'South Carolina', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Workload', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'computer human interaction', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'genetic testing', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural underserved', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'symposium', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2020,173453,136810522,0.000972474126228712
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests. The goal is to one day prevent sepsis from happening before it can do permanent, life-threatening damage to patients.",Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data,9953611,K23GM137182,"['Acetylcarnitine', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Algorithms', 'Arginine', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelium', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fatty Change', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Troponin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amino acid metabolism', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data streams', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'specific biomarkers']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,175768,507546965,0.007750665979844162
"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9830022,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,178349,533302350,-0.029118868596917744
"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,10019544,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2020,179885,92601146,-0.006667815288180901
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,66720547,-0.0029674820989626627
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9948018,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2020,189000,327644200,-0.0059302179827389005

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9975724,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,191195,807432003,-0.04733152208882297
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",10018507,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,192195,254622553,-0.038161542123104436
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10166402,U01FD007057,[' '],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2020,199999,32532200,0.00578009787838917
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,76545728,-0.009087103038062181
"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,225000,-0.001730057503262344
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. This research proposal describes a novel artificial intelligence approach for automatically assessing macular damage due to Stargardt disease and predicting its progression.",Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy,9895214,R21EY029839,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Lifting', 'Light', 'Lipofuscin', 'Macular degeneration', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Natural History', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stargardt&apos', 's disease', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Visit', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'macular dystrophy', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'social implication', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'transmission process', 'young adult']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,235500,2135841,-0.03501914967463766
"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,9967745,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,243364,228951281,-0.029773082081976435
"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,951823,-0.012219179125012086
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice.

"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions).

"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,61050884,-0.0003171613634409455
"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10019459,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,291252,807432003,-0.016023619073745915
"Validation of a lab-free low-cost screening test for prevention of cervical cancer: automated visual evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize medicine by improving productivity, reducing human error, and assisting with diagnosis and treatment. Image classification algorithms can be used to develop automated visual evaluation (AVE): a potential game-changer for cervical cancer prevention in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AVE technology reads digital photographs of a cervix to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations in seconds. AVE is a true point of care test, low cost and does not require a laboratory. AVE could be used either for stand-alone primary screening, or to triage HPV-positive women. We will compare AVE to common screening methods in LMICs: visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and conventional cytology. Enhanced Visual Assessment (EVA) System by MobileODT is a cloud-connected mobile colposcope on a smartphone platform. It is FDA cleared and used in 42 countries. MobileODT is uniquely poised to integrate AVE into the EVA System. Our aim is to validate and commercialize AVE on the EVA platform. Phase I aims will adapt AVE to run on the EVA system using an optimal neural network architecture, running either directly on the phone or as a cloud- based service. Phase II is a prospective clinical trial of 10,000 patients recruited at ministry of health sites in El Salvador. All screen-positive patients, and 10% of negative patients, will undergo colposcopy with biopsy. Sensitivity of AVE as a primary screening test will be compared to cytology and to VIA. In HPV-positive women, AVE will be compared to VIA as a triage test. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal involves developing and testing a cervical cancer screening test: automated visual evaluation (AVE) based on an image classification algorithm that runs on smartphone-based colposcope. Included are both technical development to integrate AVE to a mobile phone application (Phase I), and a prospective validation on a screening population of 10,000 women in El Salvador (Phase II).

"Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects adults of all ages yet can present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure. Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE. In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a 20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets (analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner. Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism, disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3 Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3 PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.",Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood,10081921,R43HL154941,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyspnea', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myoglobin', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Troponin I', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Venous system', 'Vermont', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'instrumentation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient safety', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,BIOCOGNIV INC.,R43,2020,299749,299749,-0.034293698828276244
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,570146095,0.0010265627475277697
"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed. n/a",Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine,10133782,R01GM140467,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Portraits', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'individual patient', 'large-scale database', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,305566,30434536,-0.010284234580903577
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9917724,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,312511,148186688,-0.028755468523245765
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks.

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation.

"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment.

"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of hospitalization in the US. Exacerbations - a worsening or “flare up” of symptoms - cause most COPD hospitalizations. Since most exacerbations can be treated with changes of inhalers and/or oral medications, at-home detection of lung function deterioration may facilitate earlier intervention and help delay or prevent hospitalizations. The Standards of Care for monitoring lung function are spirometry, plethysmography, and CT scan. However, these are expensive methods and unsuited for continuous monitoring or at-home use. Various patient self-monitoring approaches have been tried, for example, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate monitoring, and peak flow metering, but their efficacy in reducing hospitalizations has been limited.  A common finding for all forms of COPD is air trapping, defined, as an abnormal increase in the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation is complete. A body of evidence definitively shows that air trapping increases during exacerbations and decreases when exacerbations resolve. Recent reports show that air trapping is an earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes, and can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non- invasive tool when medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations.  Respira Labs has developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device that can continually monitor lung resonance: Sylvee. The device uses known acoustic-based technology with machine- learning algorithms to detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results suggest correspond to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this project is to validate Sylvee's air trapping algorithms in a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 40 COPD patients with and without air trapping, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will miniaturize and add sensors to the Sylvee device and develop a user interface (UI) and a mobile application. In Aims 3 and 4, we will create an Air Trapping Index Report and validate it in a cross-sectional study vis-à-vis whole body plethysmography as a control. Results of this project provide a go/no-go development decision based on device function. We can apply these results in STTR Phase II, in a larger clinical study to evaluate Sylvee as an at-home monitoring system, with a goal of reducing hospitalizations by at least 30%. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients' lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 12 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, and another 17 million may have COPD, but are unaware of it. By 2020, the costs associated with COPD are estimated to be $72B billion per year, of which with ~50% are the costs of spent on ER visits and hospitalizations. The goal of this proposal is to establish and validate a seamless and non-obtrusive wearable that measures abnormal air trapping via a novel acoustic technology, which would reduce hospitalizations through at-home monitoring of lung function.","Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD",10080272,R41HL152769,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Bluetooth', 'Bronchoconstriction', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Edema', 'Emergency department visit', 'Exhalation', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Miniaturization', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Noise', 'Oral', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'Wireless Technology', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air monitoring', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'novel', 'ozone exposure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"RESPIRA LABS, LLC",R41,2020,350000,350000,-0.007413096572453
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,323604360,-0.005996958237357723
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,178185562,-0.013710208571022873
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,570146095,-0.009667131288405677
"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,933478,-0.010124205797723067

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19.

"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10018827,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,394824,560644462,-0.021753041041413942
"Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted society, communities, and the healthcare system across the world, and threatens to continue to challenge society for the coming months and years. More than 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 60,000 Americans have lost their lives as of the writing of this proposal. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a wearable physiological sensing solution for COVID-19 patient management, including diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients based on lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measures captured with the same device. The central innovation lies in the hardware and algorithms that have been proposed for this purpose, building upon the team’s prior work in other areas of wearable bio-acoustic sensing and bioimpedance spectroscopy. The following two specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to design, implement, and validate a wearable sensing system for lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measurements; and (2) to test and evaluate this system to assess efficacy and potential information derived in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and persons under investigation for COVID-19 longitudinally. Successful completion of this project would result in a validated prototype for sensing multiple parameters of cardiopulmonary health in patients with COVID-19, with imminent feasibility to transition the technology to commercialization and through regulatory pathways. This would provide a much-needed patient management technology for this novel coronavirus to healthcare practitioners and ultimately a means to monitor patients remotely to ensure that any deterioration in health is detected as early as possible. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the US and the rest of the world in an unparalleled manner, taking nearly 60,000 lives in the US alone over the past two months and afflicting more than a million Americans, with costs to society that are difficult to measure or bear. Technologies for improving the management of patients presenting at the emergency room are urgently needed in this era, specifically for determining whether such patients should be cared for in the intensive care unit, via infectious diseases procedures, or otherwise. We propose to design a wearable system for measuring lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and movement in the same device to address these critical needs.","Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19",10163297,R01EB023808,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Temperature', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data Analytics', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory distress', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Temperature', 'Societies', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'synergism', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,396542,45341731,-0.016036897462688167
"SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer affecting the retina, optic nerve, and brain. Accounting for 6% of all cancers in children under the age of five, it is the world's most common primary intraocular childhood malignancy.

The current clinical practice of visually analyzing and manually contouring tumors is subjective, time-consuming, and often inconsistent. The novelty of MRIMath's explainable, trustworthy, and physician-in-the-loop AI system is multi-fold. First, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction framework using the inception modules in contracting and expanding paths of the U-Net image segmentation neural network architecture. Second, we propose a new loss function based on the modified Dice similarity coefficient. Third, we train and test the AI system using two learning regimes: learning to segment intra-tumoral structures and learning to segment glioma sub-regions. Finally, we produce heat maps to visualize the features extracted by the AI, thus offering physicians a view of AI's attention patterns and activation maps that were triggered during AI's decision-making. An intuitive and interactive User Interface will allow the physician to review contouring results, make adjustments and approve contours, visualize AI's explanations and volumetric measurements, and finally review the results of the statistical analysis.

"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening Imaging biomarkers are features in images that have biological implications. For example, in a picture of a person with red hair, the red hair is a feature and the implication is that there is a mutation in the MC1R gene that provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This feature, an imaging biomarker, can be used as a medical cue to indicate increased risk for melanoma. When used in this context, this imaging biomarker becomes an imaging biomarker cue (IBC), in the sense that it may cue the medical professional observer to alter treatment accordingly, such as recommending sunscreen use. IBCs do not individually bear the full weight of medical decision-making and instead are integrated. IBC analysis may be a process of sensory cue integration or may be a process of observation and integration by technology such as a digital camera and computer. An advantage of the latter is that computational scalability enables machine vision to compute vast permutations of IBCs that would be overwhelming to a human observer. Thus computers can try many potential diagnostic methods rapidly before picking the best one to teach back to humans. The purpose of this project is to develop a human/machine interface for bi-directional teaching so expert dermatologists can teach computers what IBCs they use to achieve accurate diagnosis and computers can teach dermatologists the best way to use current IBCs and suggest integration of new IBCs that machine learning guides them to. As an outcome, we will measure the diagnostic performance of dermatologists who undergo IBC training in detecting melanoma. It is known that early detection saves lives, but the potential of technology to improve early detection, a great need since 10,000 Americans still die each year from melanoma, is unknown. This project will help answer that unknown and if we are successful in translating IBCs with commuter vision and machine learning, more melanomas will be detected early and lives will be saved. Our long-term goal is to reduce melanoma related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by helping clinicians increase the predictive value of dermoscopy-based melanoma screening. We believe sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy- based melanoma screening for non-expert screeners can be improved by assistive technology, which is highly desirable given the cost of false positives (patient stress and unnecessary biopsies) and the extremely high cost of false negatives (delayed melanoma treatment). This project creates a technology to help medical personnel see and integrate features of abnormal skin spots that help them determine if the spot they are looking at is a melanoma. Since melanoma is deadly if left untreated, this technology helps them guide biopsy and surgical removal of skin to potentially cut more melanomas out (saving lives) and not cut so many benign lesions out unnecessarily (leaving less scars). Our augmentation of vision and cognition uses machine learning in a way that is visually intuitive so physicians may be able to show their patients the rationale behind the choice to surgically excise abnormal skin spots or not to.",Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening,10025420,R21CA240254,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement Factor D', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melanocortin 1 Receptor', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mole the mammal', 'Mutation', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Skin', 'Skin Abnormalities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'melanoma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'vector']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,412585,79116291,-0.025988513746985978
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,560644462,-0.006000544085316032
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,560644462,0.014565166629496197
"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,9946956,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,439224,797976,-0.0009823484980688978
"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,2932986,-0.02212651059426525
"Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors. Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body. Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure data. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care.

"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,127562714,-0.010290834364566251
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,9885223,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,447500,327644200,-0.06976372694645001
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,533302350,-0.005547191319253049
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,913319,-0.002802044568272288
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,533302350,0.004548706921240711
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9915874,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,486161,524978793,0.007410623916822684
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,685608202,-0.00881854610790316
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,9887973,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numerical value', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'computer monitor', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in silico', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'single molecule', 'visual stimulus']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2020,496911,6406933,-0.017902684147932387
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,903546,0.007170891445840591
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,511154,-0.009335978381083812
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,164685352,0.004924365935144807
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9977220,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,550000,533594881,-0.0016960804113105262
"A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand PROJECT SUMMARY Restoring hand function remains an elusive goal for many clinical conditions, including stroke, osteoarthritis, tetraplegia, amputation, and traumatic injury. The hand’s anatomical complexity makes restoring hand function particularly challenging because altering any one parameter in the hand can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, but essential to control. In this proposal, as a critical step toward informing personalized treatments for the hand, we will study how subject-specific differences influence hand function. Completion of this proposal will rely on collection of three datasets that are designed to provide varying levels of biomechanical detail and require varying levels of effort to collect. Briefly, these datasets include (1) a simulation dataset containing 500,000 simulations fully describing all musculoskeletal parameters involved in hand force production, (2) a dense, biomechanical datasets that describes the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity required for hand force production in 30 adults, and (3) a sparse, clinically-inspired dataset that describes demographics, anthropometrics, and clinical metrics of hand function in 1000 adults. In Aim 1, we will leverage the first two datasets to design a data-driven analysis framework that identifies the most important biomechanical parameter(s) and maps how those parameters influence hand force production. Completion of this aim will elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that modulate hand force production and evaluate the ability to use simulation data, instead of experimental data, to identify these mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will leverage all three datasets to create a transfer learning framework capable of efficiently and accurately predicting subject-specific muscle force-generating parameters from easy to collect clinical data. We specifically focus on muscle force- generating parameters because these parameters remain challenging to quickly and accurately estimate, are known to vary across the population, and are highly related to functional metrics like strength. Completion of this aim will provide a new approach for rapidly estimating subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters, thereby enabling efficient creation of subject-specific models and potentially catalyzing use of such models in a clinical setting. Overall, the results from this study could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to understand the biomechanical mechanisms underlying force production in the hand. Specifically, we utilize machine learning methods to examine how subject-specific differences influence hand force production and create subject-specific computer models from easy to obtain clinical data. The results, which integrate modeling with an individual’s clinical data, could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments.",A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand,10040078,R21EB030068,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diagnostic', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand Strength', 'Hand functions', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Production', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'bone', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hand rehabilitation', 'individual patient', 'kinematics', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromuscular', 'novel strategies', 'open-access repositories', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,560939,188894159,-0.005440440447005009
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,585067,-0.011816701317075405
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,9935719,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2020,599090,340417756,0.0001231934206017162
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9981804,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,601275,550947887,-0.010708898983720497
"Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia ABSTRACT In this competitive revision, within the same scope of developing and deploying algorithms to make a quantum leap in clinical diagnosis as that in our current U01EB021183, we would like to revise the original aims to add a new Aim to leverage our expertise in the areas of algorithm development and clinical translation to make immediate contributions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we propose to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enable chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as an alternative diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia, to rapidly triage patients for appropriate treatment, to monitor the treatment response in a contained environment, and to optimize the distribution of the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, our overarching objective is to develop automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other non-COVID-19 related pneumonia using CXR images. The advantages of the proposed AI equipped CXR technique include: i) widely available, ii) inexpensive, iii) excellent coronavirus exposure profile for patient, technologist, and equipment, and iv) rapid and automated DL interpretation, which is effectively instantaneous.",Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia,10156179,U01EB021183,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anosmia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilateral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Case Study', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Containment', 'Coronavirus', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'North America', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'War', 'World Health Organization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'neural network architecture', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'quantum', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'urgent care']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U01,2020,605070,338121506,3.4932057019512644e-05
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,560644462,0.01265861656363875
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10161464,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2020,622500,90710179,-0.019127192791598756
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,45219910,-0.006717509516460681
"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,191864802,-0.012434779414020398
"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network Since joining the NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in 2015, the NorthStar Node has made significant contributions to the objectives and priorities of the CTN. The NorthStar Node and its investigators have led or co-led five CTN protocols, served as a research site for seven CTN studies, co- chaired the CTN Steering Committee and the Data Science Work Group, served on the Research Development Committee, and contributed to several special interest groups. The NorthStar Node's research portfolio includes traditional randomized controlled trials (CTN-0068), pragmatic comparative effectiveness research (CTN-0098A and CTN-0099), implementation science (CTN-0074, CTN-0098B, and CTN-0099), community-based participatory research (CTN-0096), data science (CTN-0076 and CTN-0087), and health services research (CTN-0070). In this application, the NorthStar Node has seven guiding objectives (POLARIS): 1) generating evidence that informs Policy and clinical guidelines; 2) evaluating models addressing co-Occurring SUD and medical and psychiatric conditions; 3) using principals of a Learning health system to conduct pragmatic trials; 4) using Artificial intelligence and other data sciences approaches to enhance SUD research and care; 5) Reaching understudied populations to ensure SUD research is relevant to diverse populations; 6) using Implementation science to test the integration of evidence-based SUD practices into general medical settings; and 7) testing innovative Strategies for SUD treatment. Potential studies to meet these objectives include 1) a novel therapeutic intervention for methamphetamine use disorder; 2) development of machine learning algorithms in the electronic health record to target substance use screening and enhance substance use disorder diagnoses; 3) precision/personalized medicine studies using population pharmacokinetics to better define and refine medication dosing strategies that improve treatment outcome; and 4) testing collaborative care models to address co-occurring chronic medical illnesses in specialty addiction treatment settings. Our expertise spans multi-site clinical trials, implementation science, community-based participatory research, EHR-based interventions, machine learning and natural language processing, and health services research. In addition to community partners that include urban and rural integrated health systems, federally qualified health centers serving underrepresented minorities, specialty addiction treatment programs, and pediatric and adolescent health clinics, the NorthStar Node brings affiliated research and dissemination networks into the CTN, including CTSA, SIREN, PCORNet, JCOIN, HOPE, the Network Coordinating Office of the Addiction Technology Transfer Centers, a learning health system training program (K12), three NIDA training programs (T32), and fellowship programs in addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. The NorthStar Node is well situated to address current and emerging SUD issues and advance research in the field in order to improve patient outcome and transform health systems.

"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,641965656,-0.05524821302758454
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,241268189,0.0012539691207992024
"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,338121506,-0.04200785195118023
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,524978793,-0.011391515133748926
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,10016297,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,673491,673201228,-0.012090334834828652
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,327644200,-0.005343692499142252
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,524978793,-0.0029076236220706084
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,641965656,-0.0013733648759826872

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9970958,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,750000,981500,0.008899157669078138
"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,6384662,-0.0030037745540742364
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10133378,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,772462,254622553,-0.005881147375410165
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy.

"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,9943464,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,800637,111231681,-0.026505631228551096
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,377931988,0.003351489383460231
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,869698,-0.008527153951302383
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,938347,-0.0018275051496819013
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. n/a",A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions,9926849,R44CA228897,"['Antigens', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Digestion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microtomy', 'Monitor', 'Nevus', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical shape', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cloud software', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'histopathological examination', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality risk', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skin lesion', 'tissue preparation', 'web interface']",NCI,"FRONTIER DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2020,944492,944492,-0.027498710537081167
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,989523,-0.0016160723090385665
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9970170,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,991540,51931732,-0.0019448984321958412
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years.

"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy,10156035,R44DC017422,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Appointment', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Unit', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'External auditory canal', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resistance development', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'electronic data capture system', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'image guided', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'middle ear fluid', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R44,2020,1136886,1136886,-0.007556854370004175
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,377931988,-0.028410298151824928
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,685608202,-0.038369259638092526
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,1992588,-0.07249266376092722
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.  Data collected under this project will be deidentified and securely transmitted to an NIH data hub. n/a",DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION,10274152,5N91020C00040,"['Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biosensor', 'COVID-19', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hospitalization', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Secure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational platform', 'coronavirus disease', 'data hub', 'digital', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'wearable device']",NCI,"VGBIO, INC.",N01,2020,2305814,2305814,-0.013286774193224785
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,415711940,-0.004475268783721923
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9757500,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,641965656,-0.016647611920680563
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9794293,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,58207,524978793,0.007410623916822684
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,111231681,-0.008317243792348512
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,533302350,-0.0073480297017201185
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2019,130618,37281765,-0.002555911042986777
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,232986943,-0.010907370056697056
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness Abstract Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the detection of OH are associated with a “failure to rescue” and a dramatic deterioration in prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. While uniplex noninvasive technologies have failed to detect or diagnose complex disease states, we have demonstrated the superiority of multiplex approaches in silico. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a commercially viable optoimpedance sensor-based system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. Phase I will involve three Aims: 1) D​esign, Fabricate and Test Opto-Impedance oPiic sensors, 2) Develop of Mobile App, Data and ML Pipeline on Secure Cloud, and 3) Evaluate oPiics on an Unanesthetized Upright Porcine Hemorrhage Model. By derisking the hardware challenges, we will be well-positioned for a Phase II application to optimize oPiic design and manufacturing, fold-in predictive algorithms under current development with DOD support, and validate with a clinical trial in critical care setting. Project Narrative We have demonstrated that a multiplex approach is superior to predicting shock compared to single clinical devices alone. During a mass-casualty event, a predictive tool would need to be deployed widely, since only a fraction of individuals will have ongoing hemorrhage that will progress to decompensated shock. Optical and bioimpedance signals are critical indicators of muscle hemodynamics and electrolyte balance likely to be modified in the period leading up to shock. No commercial device exists that provides continuous, low-power, low-cost monitoring of these signals with characteristics suitable for integration with the multiplexing approach. This STTR application seeks Phase I funding to commercialize an opto-impedance sensor, called the ‘oPiic’, that will address this unmet need.",Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness,9909081,R41EB029284,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber Optics', 'Funding', 'General anesthetic drugs', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electric impedance', 'electrical property', 'hemodynamics', 'instrument', 'light weight', 'mass casualty', 'member', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'optical sensor', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tissue oxygenation', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,"MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS, INC.",R41,2019,155282,0,-0.0018590899302468188
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,64946317,-0.007655118754613095
"Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones PROJECT SUMMARY Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries; many of its complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home. PROJECT NARRATIVE Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries affecting over 1.23 billion people in 2013 and can lead to complications such as hearing loss, developmental delay, meningitis, mastoiditis, and death. Many of these complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. However, the absence of an accurate and accessible method to detect middle ear fluid has led to high misdiagnosis rates. The consequence is associated hearing and speech impairment rates greater than any other pediatric condition and growing microbial resistance as a result of antibiotic over-prescription. Currently, the technique of choice for detecting middle ear fluid by primary care providers is visual otoscopy, which has a diagnostic accuracy as low as 51%. Although more accurate methods like tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy exist, they require significant expertise and referral to a specialist. Commercial acoustic reflectometers and smartphone-mounted otoscopes require specialized hardware. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for an accurate, rapid and easily accessible method for resource-limited healthcare providers and caregivers to detect middle ear fluid. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using the speakers and microphones on existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. Our proposed system would operate by (i) sending a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detecting reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employing a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status. No additional attachments would be required beyond a paper funnel, which acts as a speculum to reduce waveform variability and can be constructed with printer paper, scissors, and tape. This technique is the first software-based screening tool for middle ear fluid detection that uses off-the-shelf smartphones which does not require hardware attachments or visual interpretation. Using data from our existing preliminary clinical study we aim to develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to optimize sensitivity and specificity. We plan to develop a bench testing technique that enables previously unsupported smartphones to to run our test and prospectively validate our optimized algorithm clinically in parallel testing with an acoustic reflectometer. Further we aim to develop a user interface and improved funnel design. These new designs will undergo usability testing in physician and parent populations. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, our app has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home.",Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones,9906782,R43DC018434,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Earwax', 'Environment', 'External auditory canal', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Galaxy', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Industry Standard', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastoiditis', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obstruction', 'Otitis Media', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Speculums', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Tympanometry', 'Visual', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'microbial', 'microphone', 'middle ear', 'prospective', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'urgent care', 'usability']",NIDCD,"WAVELY DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2019,157842,0,-0.0014481016864742373
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9670145,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke risk', 'stroke therapy', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2019,163080,228951281,-0.018322418030964877
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,146629556,-0.00886682584517782
"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning).

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,593605914,-0.00601195223696664
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,5678328,-0.0050608574128524625
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,560644462,0.0014318674218040254
"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,9773333,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2019,186679,92601146,-0.006667815288180901
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9704042,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2019,189000,327644200,-0.0059302179827389005
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,524978793,0.00603986451616957
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9846869,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2019,191195,807432003,-0.04733152208882297
"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9790958,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'central database', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,199142,241268189,-0.008733342773209377
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU.

"Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to interpret TOMi Scope depth-resolved images using a set of ear models with human middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, antibiotic stewardship for ear health. Significance: Ear infections affect 95% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antibiotic over-prescription and antibiotic resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of MEE through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic accuracy (50- 70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user experience. Therefore, objective image classification metrics to enable improved diagnostic accuracy is sorely needed to finally provide children afflicted by this disease with the correct treatment the first time. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope image classification of a set of ear models with human MEE will facilitate detection of the presence or absence of effusion (≥90% accuracy), as well as classification by the type of effusion samples (≥80% accuracy), regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect robust datasets of ex vivo human MEE, sufficient for machine learning image analysis. (2) Develop a neural network model based on the MEE dataset and apply the model to a representative test clinical dataset to determine classification feasibility. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antibiotic prescription but also antibiotic resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience dependence of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management,9847606,R43DC017422,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Infection', 'Intestines', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Resistance development', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Sterility', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'ex vivo imaging', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'middle ear', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R43,2019,223899,1136886,-0.01352823997593591

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,599695,0.004910868594740117
"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'American', 'Boston', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fatigue', 'Forehead', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human Rights', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'communication device', 'deafness', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering', 'rehabilitation science', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'signal processing', 'technology development', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,1532918,-0.07249105698552126
"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments.

"A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides Abstract/Summary In this SBIR, we propose to validate our handcrafted image analysis algorithm for auto-detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in a digitized sputum smear. Once validated in a blinded study against manual microscopy and culture (the gold standard), we will try to improve our handcrafted algorithm by integrating, where appropriate, deep-learning approaches (via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Our novel diagnostic device (the Diascopic iON platform) uses automated image analysis to detect pathogens of interest. Through a blinded study (400 slides), we will assess the iON's effectiveness in detecting MTB. Our aim is to achieve >99% accuracy vs. microscopy, and sensitivity-specificity vs. culture of 80% and 99%, respectively. Currently, the iON platform can detect MTB on a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained sputum smear in less than 60 seconds, with accuracy of 95% vs. microscopy. The primary objective of this SBIR is to meet or exceed the minimal requirements for the WHO Target Product Profile (published 2014) of a rapid sputum-based test for detecting TB at the microscopy-center level of the health-care system. We will accomplish this feasibility study through a collaborative effort with the Case Western Reserve University-Uganda (UCRC) research team. A full-slide digitization and automated image analysis of 400 ZN slides is planned while on the ground in Uganda. Results will be published in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal for dissemination to the relevant TB pathology and provider community. A secondary objective of this SBIR is to improve our handcrafted algorithm through the use of deep- learning techniques (CNN). We will collaborate with Dr. Madabhushi (Case Western Reserve) - a world leader in Deep Learning methodologies – on this portion of the study. We are optimistic that by combining our handcrafted approach with a deep-learning approach, we can identify MTB bacilli more effectively (i.e. faster and more accurately). We will leverage the lessons-learned in this study to develop algorithms for other developing-world diseases like Onchocerca (river blindness), Plasmodium (malaria), and Shistomes (schistosomaisis). Successful completion of this SBIR will show that the iON can truly become a platform for automated pathogen detection, which will shift lab practices toward faster & more standardized routines that are performed by unskilled workers. If we're successful in this Phase I SBIR, we will develop auto-detect algorithms for 3-4 other pathogens in a phase II SBIR. We will then market the iON platform to resource-limited clinics in countries adversely affected by developing-world diseases. It is our experience that such clinics are seeking a rapid, low cost, accurate and simple diagnostic tool to improve their efficiency and their ability to detect and treat diseases. Narrative This SBIR is a validation study of a digital pathology platform to detect TB in digitized Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) slides. We aim to establish a high accuracy (>99%) vs. manual microscopy and a sensitivity & specificity of 80% and 99%, respectively, vs. culture. The TB analysis occurs rapidly, with results available in <60 seconds. We will investigate whether algorithm improvements are possible by combining our handcrafted approach with deep-learning approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency. If high accuracy and sensitivity-specificity can be achieved for TB detection, this low-cost technology can have a significant impact on TB laboratory operations around the world. The technology can also be applied to other pathogens whose primary method of detection is microscopy.",A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides,9851233,R43EB028736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Blinded', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Low income', 'Malaria', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Ocular Onchocerciasis', 'Onchocerca', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Universities', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'man', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'portability', 'prevent', 'remote location', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIBIB,"DIASCOPIC, LLC",R43,2019,225000,0,-0.005599845484160512
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts.

Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Engineering', 'Environmental air flow', 'Family member', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Snoring', 'Sorbus', 'Spinal Cord', 'Study Subject', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Thick', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Trachea', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'alertness', 'base', 'body position', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microphone', 'mu opioid receptors', 'notch protein', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'synthetic opioid', 'time use', 'trend', 'vibration', 'volunteer', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"RTM VITAL SIGNS, LLC",R41,2019,236381,0,-0.010847952886344362
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",9805011,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,240804,254622553,-0.038161542123104436
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices. The tools will be applied to various clinical tasks such as detection and prediction of seizure and arrhythmia and classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, aiming for more accurate diagnosis.",QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,9771321,R01EB025018,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Sleep Stages', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'education resources', 'experience', 'frontier', 'geometric methodologies', 'graduate student', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical theory', 'monitoring device', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'science education', 'signal processing', 'student training', 'theories', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,255543,30434536,-0.0011548277461502804
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Budgets', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Equipment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glass', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Thioflavin S', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disease phenotype', 'histological specimens', 'histological stains', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropathology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'spatial relationship', 'synergism', 'transmission process', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,254622553,-0.056808258269549

"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement. NARRATIVE A leaky inlet valve of the major pumping chamber of the heart is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients.

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,9976740,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,299197,807432003,-0.016023619073745915
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,61050884,-0.0003171613634409455
"Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms. The broad goal of this project is to adapt a portable, low-cost, easy-to-use Pocket-sized Colposcope (developed under other funding) for use in a community setting, and develop automated algorithms that combine neovascularization, glycogen depletion and acetowhitening to provide comparable diagnosis to an expert. This work will be done in a collaboration between 3rd Stone Design, Inc, Duke University and Kenya Medical Research Institute. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1 (Phase I): Improve Pocket colposcope by designing continuous magnification mechanism and improving device workflow integration to eliminate between-use disinfection through the use of a disposable optically clear sterile sleeve. Provider feedback on our previously developed Pocket colposcope has unanimously suggested the addition of a slider mechanism to control coarse zoom and a sleeve consumable to the Pocket colposcope design.  Aim 2 (Phase I): Automated algorithms and software for cervical pre-cancer detection We will improve the specificity of VIA using a novel software application with embedded machine learning diagnostic algorithms for automated cervical cancer screening. We will apply and validate the individual algorithms for VIA and GIVI (green illumination vascular imaging) to existing images obtained from a 200-patient clinical study with the Pocket colposcope. We will then compare the performance of the algorithms to expert physician interpretation of the same images, with pathology serving as the gold standard.  Aim 3 (Phase II): Document user experience with Pocket colposcope in Kenya. We will develop a culturally relevant training package directly in the community healthcare setting. We will collect quantitative and qualitative data including surveys, in-depth interviews, and clinic observations from both naive providers and patients and use these findings to and use these findings to improve the introduction of the Pocket colposcope in Kenya and simultaneously, inform the clinical investigations in Aim 4.  Aim 4 (Phase II): Compare the performance of the Pocket colposcope to Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid for triage of HPV+ women in Kenya. We will carry out a cluster-randomized trial among 400 HPV+ women to compare the standard triage with that using the Pocket colposcope in Kisumu, Kenya. All HPV+ women will undergo biopsy to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the different triage strategies. Data will be used to model the performance of the algorithm against that of expert colposcopists.  Aim 5 (Phase II): Assess the costs, incremental cost-effectiveness and population health impact of HPV-based cervical cancer screening programs with proposed triage strategies. We will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the absolute and relative costs for four triage strategies by measuring the costs and model population health outcomes (cancer cases, deaths and disability adjusted life years). NARRATIVE The SBIR activities proposed by 3rd Stone Design and Duke University will advance the state of the art in cervical cancer imaging through the R&D of novel optics for a portable colposcope combined with automated algorithms for diagnosis. The project will confirm the benefits of these innovations through a clinical trial in Kenya conducted by the Kenya Medical Research Institutes. The innovations developed have tremendous potential to effect public health by increasing diagnostic acuity and decreasing costs of healthcare delivery which ultimately will reduce the impact of the deadly disease.",Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms.,9778122,R44CA240019,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Community Health', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Measures', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disinfection', 'Feedback', 'Fogs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kenya', 'Lesion', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medical Research', 'Modeling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sledding', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness ratio', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'incremental cost-effectiveness', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mortality', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overtreatment', 'point of care', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'relative cost', 'research and development', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R44,2019,299992,300000,-0.026418255824508404
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,570146095,0.0010265627475277697
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs.

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9707393,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,313021,148186688,-0.028755468523245765
"Common Fund Data Supplement: Integration of KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS into MARRVEL 2.0 for machine learning-assisted rare variant prioritization Project Summary  This application is being submitted in response to NOT-RM-19-009 as a supplement to the parent award U54NS093793.  The Common Fund supports a number of resources that can significantly enhance gene and variant prioritization for study in the Model Organisms Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond. To facilitate the use of these resources, we propose to create a tool that can be easily accessed by clinical geneticists and model organism scientists alike.  MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) was created two years ago because important data that is necessary for rare variant analysis for personalized medicine is spread throughout the internet in tens of different locations. To improve efficiency and streamline access to these data sources, we created a web-tool that allows users to query tens of data sources at once, including GTEx, and links to IMPC, the display portal for KOMP2.  In this proposal, our goal is to develop version 2 of MARRVEL to promote the use of Common Fund resources in the rare disease research community for manual and automated data analysis. This goal will be accomplished by developing MARRVEL 2.0 by integrating KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS data and using the aggregated dataset to develop a machine-assisted gene and variant prioritization for diagnosis and animal model generation.  Our goals align with those of the NIH Common Fund to increase the utility of resources for broader use in the biomedical community.

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North).

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,9859232,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,345016,560644462,-0.0020762219065276494
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,1992588,-0.07249266376092722
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9608754,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,356625,323604360,-0.005996958237357723
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,9827476,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,401628,560644462,-0.021753041041413942
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM. This project proposes the development of a fully-automated malaria retinopathy detection system consisting of a low-cost retinal camera and automatic malaria retinopathy detection software.",Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria,10002542,R44AI112164,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Malaria', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Medicine', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Uganda', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zambia', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'software systems', 'success', 'usability']",NIAID,VISIONQUEST BIOMEDICAL INC,R44,2019,412048,1989109,-0.014752771037262627
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9693150,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,423601,524978793,0.007410623916822684
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,560644462,-0.006000544085316032
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,685608202,-0.00881854610790316
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,533302350,0.004548706921240711
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought.

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9617686,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,507649,533302350,-0.029118868596917744
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9750520,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2019,507856,0,-0.03425604665132936
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,164685352,0.004924365935144807
"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,55000,-0.006016362015777778
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,570146095,-0.005363149458938896
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics of clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,869698,-0.008527153951302383
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,560644462,0.01265861656363875
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9631317,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,656406,1273999,0.0012539691207992024
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,9712304,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,657823,673201228,-0.012090334834828652
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9722313,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,658069,570146095,-0.0021890625845299417
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,91477866,-0.018419555489942223
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,327644200,-0.005343692499142252
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,524978793,-0.0029076236220706084
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,533594881,-0.0016960804113105262
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,641965656,-0.0013733648759826872
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9748417,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,991540,51931732,-0.0019448984321958412
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma. Successful completion of this Fast Track project will result in a fully documented and validated assay ready for launch as a laboratory developed test.",A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions,9905050,R44CA228897,"['Amendment', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Digestion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melanocytic Neoplasm', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microtomy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nevus', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical shape', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cloud software', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'histopathological examination', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality risk', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skin lesion', 'tissue preparation', 'web interface']",NCI,"FRONTIER DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2019,998671,944492,-0.025711807161435247
"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,327644200,-0.014925695320870555

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,9831333,UL1TR003017,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asian Indian', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Cuban', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Management', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'Muslim population group', 'New Jersey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ontology', 'Oral health', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Science', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Special Populations Research', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Workforce Development', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohesion', 'community based participatory research', 'disease heterogeneity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'logarithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'trial design']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,UL1,2019,4776211,19710604,-0.005885555325715382
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,415711940,-0.004475268783721923
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms.

This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states.

"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9698505,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,50000,0,-0.025145861533036964
"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,0,-0.04143921677542258
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,232986943,-0.010907370056697056
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9595012,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2018,147838,292134808,-0.020870517163463376
"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work and improve the capacity of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care patterns across hospitals using electronic health record data, and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better sepsis prevention and treatment strategies.  ","Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care",9532741,K08HS025008,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2018,149472,14964406,-0.001461086011507285
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9521378,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adult obesity', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2018,155914,58406802,-0.009809961399988892
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,507546965,0.00603986451616957
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format. If successful, the instrument will likely be utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening of patients), and research professionals.",An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking,9620574,R41GM130202,"['Acceleration', 'Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Elasticity', 'Engineering', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microspheres', 'Motion', 'Mucociliary Clearance', 'Mucolytics', 'Mucous body substance', 'Output', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Spottings', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Video Microscopy', 'Viscosity', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cloud based', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'movie', 'novel', 'operation', 'particle', 'patient screening', 'physical science', 'pre-clinical', 'submicron', 'virtual', 'viscoelasticity']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2018,224894,0,-0.009778474184195843
"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,981315,-0.016562958750104922
"A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death Bioresp Technologies, Inc. proposes development of RespiLife, a new wearable device to to track physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts to relevant caregivers for further intervention.

"Retinal eye-tracking for the prognosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis Abstract The goal of this project is to validate an innovative, highly sensitive retinal eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, namely multiple sclerosis (MS). The applications of effective treatments for multiple sclerosis are constrained by (1) the absence of methods for early detection and (2) quantitative, highly sensitive methods monitoring deficits early in disease course when treatment may have a better chance of success. As already demonstrated, the TSLO is capable of rapidly assessing and measuring the extraordinarily fine, microscopic motion of the human eye during fixation in MS patients. Fixational eye movements are neurally-encoded, involuntary movements that require the coordination of many areas of the central nervous system. Given the TSLO’s theoretical sensitivity to change (0.2 arcminutes) and its precision of measurement - fixational eye movements have the potential utility for tracking neurodegenerative disease progression at an unprecedented scale. With the advent of the new FDA-approved MS treatment targeting B-cells (ocrelizumab), clinical tools are now desperately needed to not only assess treatment efficacy, but to objectively assess patient disability at the earliest stage of disease in order to cut relapse rates and prevent irrevocable disability. In this project, we will determine the optimal fixational eye motion metrics to distinguish patients from controls, establish the relationship between clinical disease severity measures and fixational eye movement deficits as defined by the TSLO system, and to use machine learning algorithms to further strengthen our fixational metrics. Narrative The goal of our project is to clinically validate a retinal imaging and eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,560644462,-0.008559110751856397
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9406887,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2018,248969,551214295,0.011167328109008433
"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9669491,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,252169,241268189,-0.008733342773209377
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices. The tools will be applied to various clinical tasks such as detection and prediction of seizure and arrhythmia and classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, aiming for more accurate diagnosis.",QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,9568758,R01EB025018,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Sleep Stages', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'frontier', 'geometric methodologies', 'graduate student', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical theory', 'monitoring device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'science education', 'signal processing', 'student training', 'theories', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,258070,30434536,-0.0011548277461502804

"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,1000000,-0.005527298908077714
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMapTM, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma.

"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly  heterogeneous;;  clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  systems  have  the  potential  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  and  prediction  of  pediatric  sepsis, if the underlying diversity of the pediatric population is correctly addressed. We will develop a machine-­ learning-­based  sepsis  CDS  system  by  using  multi-­task  learning  techniques

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,276703803,0.00757864820681294
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,9621149,R43NS098840,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscle Cramp', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neonatology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical period', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'perinatal brain', 'postnatal period', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEUROCOMP SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2018,300502,0,-0.01729223792752001
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,570146095,0.0010265627475277697
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs.

"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,0,0.01634670931302993
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior.

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North).

"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,0,-0.006526564844972185
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,323604360,-0.005996958237357723
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,551214295,-0.008199343506344204
"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment Project Summary This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD). Advances in smartphone hardware, computer vision, and machine learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone-based cognitive testing applications able to collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early indicators of future disease progression. In this project, we aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphone- based cognitive testing platform, called CTX, that will enable the rapid development and deployment of smartphone-based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion, subsample and compress the combined streams, and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modeling. CTX will provide a high-level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone-based cognitive testing application by providing an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be collected and when. The framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor data, synchronizing it, and transmitting it to a back-end server. The API will also have a variety of other high-level features to facilitate development of cognitive test apps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTX, in Aim 1 of this project we will develop the software framework, back-end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the platform's features. For Aim 2, we will develop three different tests for this app to test saccade (eye movement) latency, verbal recall, and wrist mobility, each collecting a different type of sensor data (video, audio, and inertial measurement). These tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive of MCI. We will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designs. Successful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype collection equipment (e.g., eye tracking stations) and create the possibility of generating data from which MCI onset can be predicted. Data collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and specific, transforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at-home use by millions of people. Project Narrative This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD) by developing a revolutionary new smartphone-based cognitive testing platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive health. Doctors who are given access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely diagnoses. By studying test results from many people, researchers may someday be able to identify patterns that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment from normative age-related cognitive decline.",Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment,9679400,R43AG062072,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Apple', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Forearm', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rotation', 'Saccades', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Tablets', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Yang', 'age related', 'age related cognitive change', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data modeling', 'diagnostic screening', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success']",NIA,"PARABON NANOLABS, INC.",R43,2018,394297,0,-0.056128579594095375
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes.

"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9465330,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,503162,0,-0.025145861533036964
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9644103,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2018,519349,0,-0.03383206927819196
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9570304,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,528639,550947887,-0.010708898983720497
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9522037,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,536041,338121506,-0.013890996986021089
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,164685352,0.004924365935144807
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,551214295,-0.010000907802898619
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,570146095,-0.005363149458938896
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9395897,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,621132,533302350,-0.029118868596917744
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9502383,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,658069,570146095,-0.0021890625845299417
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9463552,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694555,1273999,0.0012539691207992024
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,533594881,-0.0016960804113105262
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,524978793,-0.0029076236220706084
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,685608202,-0.005343692499142252
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9542295,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'social', 'social model', 'societal costs', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'visiting scholar', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,955747,560644462,0.01030879834731062
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9577245,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,1329765,51931732,-0.0019448984321958412

"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms.

"Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human visual object recognition is foundational to many achievements—from object name learning to tool use to real world problem solving. Understanding the developmental processes that underlie visual object recognition is of critical importance because the individual differences that characterize early visual object recognition have clinical, educational, and societal implications. For instance, toddlers with poor visual object recognition skills are more likely to have below-average vocabulary sizes. Toddlers with smaller vocabularies have a greater likelihood of developing language impairments and are more likely to lag in pre-literacy and literacy skills. Deficits in visual object recognition and word learning have also been exhibited by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ADSs). The overarching goal of the proposed project is to better understand the sensory-motor mechanisms that support visual object recognition. Considerable evidence suggests that active object manipulation relates to better visual object recognition, however little is known about the mechanisms through which object manipulation connects to visual object processing during development. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that one major route through which object manipulation matters is that it generates many different views of the same object, and that the variation within multiple visual instances of the same object facilitates visual object recognition by building more generalizable representations for recognizing unseen instances. This hypothesis is tested by (1) characterizing the properties of object information generated by infants during free play and by (2) evaluating the information in those generated visual streams by feeding them to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the first computational models of vision capable of human-like visual recognition. Two additional lines of research motivate the approach. First is evidence showing infants learn from statistical regularities in visual inputs presented briefly in a laboratory setting. Second is research using head-mounted cameras suggesting that object views generated by infant manipulation have unique properties, including views dominated by a single object. What we do not yet know are the visual statistics of the views infants generate in everyday toy play or their value for a statistical learner such as CNNs. The proposed research will address these gaps in the literature by characterizing the visual object inputs infants generate and how these inputs may facilitate visual object recognition. The proposed research will also determine how differences in visual inputs may be linked with individual differences in infant object name learning. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the early development of visual object recognition, and may also provide a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of other cognitive functions, including object name learning. Moreover, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed research has the potential to inform (1) individual differences in learning, (2) strategies for identifying learning delays, and (3) construction of interventions to remediate learning delays. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to characterize the nature of infants' early visual experiences of objects and their relation to object manipulation, language abilities, and computational models of object recognition. The period of development to be studied – 18 to 24 months – is a period in which delays in visual object recognition and in vocabulary learning have been connected to future development of language impairments and diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The proposed research is highly relevant to public health as it will elucidate sources of individual differences in early object recognition and word learning, laying the foundation for aiding diagnosis of early language delay and ASDs, as well as the development of future object recognition and vocabulary/language intervention programs.",Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning,9395459,F32HD093280,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'feeding', 'intervention program', 'language impairment', 'literacy', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vision development', 'visual object processing', 'word learning']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,57066,38099707,-0.026318877552106355
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,68981,560644462,0.01030879834731062
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,0,0.001731893190396178
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,59298088,0.009459717814524858
"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9528113,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2017,155914,58406802,-0.009809961399988892
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9294543,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke treatment', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2017,163080,228951281,-0.018322418030964877
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9356362,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'rural area', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,164421,113554200,-0.014315049599684517
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,560644462,0.0014318674218040254
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9316700,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical imaging', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2017,187400,327644200,-0.0059302179827389005
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,607172798,0.0021131733000544894
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,507546965,0.00603986451616957
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,560644462,-0.008559110751856397
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,38247784,0.013549265889438023
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,2510992,0.0011575976637958978
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9251814,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,300000,276703803,0.00757864820681294
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,570146095,0.0010265627475277697
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9150601,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2017,326571,7208224,0.0022709530911867513
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,323604360,-0.005996958237357723
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9254614,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,377260,551214295,-0.008199343506344204
"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,0,-0.006585801110139314
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9339455,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2017,500000,0,0.003243748768420673
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,338121506,-0.013890996986021089
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,164685352,0.004924365935144807
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,570146095,-0.005363149458938896
"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9258221,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,609467,533302350,-0.029118868596917744
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9357725,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,687081,570146095,-0.0021890625845299417
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,1273999,0.0012539691207992024
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,699413,-0.0109483056970083
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9239538,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,36936,228951281,-0.009809961399988892
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9270103,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2016,43143,338121506,-0.008044325254967673
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,74382276,-0.009303939039100982
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,68981,560644462,0.01030879834731062

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,9068774,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporotic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2016,91800,558628098,-0.01196813944428573
"Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr) EMPIRICAL TESTING AND ENHANCEMENT OF WEB-BASED ABSTRACT SCREENING TOOL (ABSTRACKR)  In this year-long project, we aim to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine and stakeholder-driven comparative effectiveness reviews. We have developed AbstrackrTM (hereon, Abstrackr), a human-guided computerized abstract screening tool that aims to reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. Abstrackr makes use of machine learning techniques, and is offered as a free web-based tool that enables management of the screening process.  We also aim to revise the web-interface of Abstrackr to make it more intuitive, user friendly, and add documentation and functionalities requested by users; and to revise Abstrackr’s back-end, which includes the way the software parses and analyses citations, fits machine learning models, and makes computations, to make it more efficient. These revisions will ensure that the tool becomes more robust, and that it remains usable for larger projects and for many teams.  The proposed work will be carried out by the developers of Abstrackr, comprising a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators and computer scientists at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, who have been working together for at least seven years. We will pursue dissemination of the findings of this assessment and of the revised tool through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its wider adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program, Cochrane Collaboration, and other groups conducting systematic reviews. We will also continue to make all code available online. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Empirically measure the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction algorithms in Abstrackr in the computer-assisted semi-automated screening of citations for eligibility in systematic reviews. Aim 2. Improve and add to the functionality of the Web-based Abstrackr software, based in part on enhancements suggested by a panel of identified heavy users. Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making and systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to assess the performance and efficiency of a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care, and to augment the functionality of its public implementation.",Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr),9168247,R03HS024812,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,99999,127562714,0.002684233380091715
"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,241268189,0.00851903566136403
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,59298088,0.009459717814524858
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9096792,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,155914,228951281,-0.009809961399988892
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.            ",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9023921,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2016,178072,29585825,-0.022786160530995105
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,560644462,0.0014318674218040254
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8998947,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,180061,807432003,-0.01855851954286531
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9018346,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2016,181365,113554200,-0.014315049599684517
"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,9116734,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'age-related muscle loss', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,184503,5488393,-0.02679145815350062
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9180344,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2016,188040,327644200,-0.0059302179827389005
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9147610,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,190216,507546965,0.00603986451616957
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,77607041,-0.0014222046557351663
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,38247784,0.013549265889438023
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,276703803,0.00757864820681294
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,90710179,-0.01561554367736314
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).            ",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9103405,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Boxing', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staff Work Load', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,656467,570146095,-0.0021890625845299417
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,570146095,-0.005363149458938896

"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,699413,-0.0109483056970083
"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of features, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combination of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penalization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools availble for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8828718,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2015,64005,0,-0.028350472474502092
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,74382276,-0.009303939039100982
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,558628098,-0.01196813944428573
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8997225,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,94089,90710179,-0.01561554367736314
"HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our research is focused on the use of advanced ontological models as a foundation for computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems that link hospitalized patient data routinely captured in electronic medical records (EMRs) with medical knowledge to effectively influence timely awareness and treatment choices by clinicians. Our phase 1 goal is to demonstrate how our advanced CDS technology has the potential to improve preventable mortality outcomes associated with sepsis in ICU patients. We distinguish two types of CDS algorithms available today for detecting and/or predicting sepsis using EMR data: 1) evidence-based ""knowledge-driven"" detection algorithms; and 2) data-driven ""predictive"" algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Recent studies indicate currently available CDS tools do not reduce risk of death in hospitalized patients. We believe this may be because diseases such as sepsis are time-sensitive, complex syndromes and also due to the challenges of computerized reuse of unstructured EMR data. Our sepsis ontology models this complexity to: a) provide enhanced knowledge-driven sepsis risk- stratified cohort classifications that help guide interventions; b) support accurate natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes to enhance real-time sepsis risk detection; and c) improve the accuracy of data- driven prediction models when used in conjunction with ML training algorithms. Our CDS is based on proprietary cluster computing technology we call ""VFusion"" designed to efficiently deal with the generation and practical use of large, application domain-specific ontologies. Our sepsis ontology employs a family of upper level ontologies, combined with granular evidence-based domain ontologies, configurable rule sets (e.g. first order logic-based), and required components of reference terminologies. Our research will use openly available ICU patient data to establish statistical detection/prediction performance metrics using this ontology in 2 modes of use: 1) as a knowledge-based screening tool to detect subtle signs of sepsis in individualized hospitalized patients; 2) used in conjunction with ML to improve data-driven predictive performance. We will measure specificity/sensitivity, and positive/negative predictive power of our hybrid ontology-based technology to demonstrate dramatically improved performance over existing CDS algorithms. In Phase II we plan a retrospective demonstration with a much larger sample of patients to include non-ICU patients in collaboration with a major healthcare system. Our product vision is an early inpatient sepsis detection algorithm with high accuracy embodied as a ""plug-in application"" compatible with any modern EMR platform in use at a client hospital effective in both ICU and non-ICU care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Even with the advent of powerful, new computer medical record technologies used in hospitals, the risk of death has not been reduced in hospitalized patients. The goal of this research effort is to combine medical record systems with advanced cognitive technologies that are commonly used today in products such as the iPhone ""Siri"" to improve clinician awareness and decisions that will dramatically reduce preventable mortality. Our initial use case will be the management of sepsis--=the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units in hospitals                ",HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA,9046860,R43LM012291,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mortality Determinants', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2015,149100,0,0.013303377131852678
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arithmetic', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Bone Tissue', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumer Advocacy', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Dislocations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hip region structure', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteolysis', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Radiation', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'follow-up', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'human subject', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'sample fixation', 'tool']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,0,0.0015189190313529188
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8935814,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2015,155674,228951281,-0.009809961399988892

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,560644462,0.0014318674218040254
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,507546965,0.00603986451616957
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,30434536,-0.05213887851579743
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,304670088,-0.02598502564912076
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.                ",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8826350,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,215393,807432003,-0.01855851954286531
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,533302350,-0.0042724011875800594
"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner. Timely intervention will help slow the progression of AMD in such patients. Easy quantification of AMD pathological indicators will spur clinical research and drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable measurement of efficacy of novel treatment methods.            ",Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening,8981869,R43EY025984,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Fundus', 'Gold', 'Health Services', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Legal Blindness', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'detector', 'dietary supplements', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2015,224999,1300000,-0.021924433121015226
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,86807134,-0.00692681133421027
"A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preclinical evaluation of treatment strategies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases is highly dependent on mouse models. Classical methods to assess the visual function of animals, such as electroretinogram (ERG), which measures electrical responses in the retina, do not address connections between the eye and brain or visual perception by the visual system. This often raises concerns regarding the functional relevance of the therapeutic benefit. Difficulty in assessing visual perception and related behavior in mice and rats, largely due to their subtle visual behavior cues and the lack of adequate measuring devices, presents a critical barrier to the application of mouse models for evaluating treatment efficacy of new drugs, and for scaling up for behavior phenotyping to screen genetic vision defects. Pupillary light reflex (PLR) and optokinetic reflex (OKR) tests are useful methods in clinics for assessing human visual responses and perception. However, such tests have been difficult to conduct in rodents because current rodent visual testing methods or devices either do not allow accurate quantitative assessment for PLR or OKR or use subjective measures to score visual responses. To address these challenges, we propose to advance the technology by designing an easy-to-use automated platform that employs an eye/pupil tracking device equipped with a computer vision system (chiefly the interactive tracking system) for unambiguous objective scoring of visual responses. Our proposed new device will allow real-time quantitative and accurate assessment of rodent visual function including light responses, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The novelty of our system also lies in that it does not require complicated calibration procedures needed in commonly used human eye tracking. Rather than precisely measuring the extent of eye turning (or orientation), we propose to detect the signature eye movement in accordance with the speed and direction of visual stimuli. The system will be validated using normal wildtype mice and mouse models of retinal neurodegeneration known to develop visual behavior changes in the parameters mentioned above. Although rodent eye tracking has been investigated before, this proposed visual assessment system would be the first commercially viable product that uses an eye/pupil tracking device to automatically assess visual perception in rodents. The combined PLR and OKR tests and vastly simplified and automated quantification methods will also provide the first scalable behavior platform for phenotyping and drug discovery in the vision research area. In the future, this technology has the potential of being expanded to measure responses from various visual stimuli. This may translate into broader applications for evaluating brain diseases that afflict the visual pathways. This platform for mouse visual behavior assessment will therefore greatly facilitate drug discovery and development aimed at preventing and slowing vision loss or restoring sight, helping to combat devastating blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the current proposal is to design and develop an automated system for the measure of rodent (mice and rats) light response, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. The system will apply human eye/pupil tracking techniques for objective and unambiguous evaluation of light response and visual perception. This platform will provide a powerful tool for phenotypic studies as well as for discovery of new drugs that can prevent or restore sight caused by blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.                ",A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery,8980787,R41EY025913,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroretinography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Screening', 'Glaucoma', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Procedures', 'Pupil', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Rattus', 'Reflex action', 'Research Institute', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'computer generated', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'genetic approach', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid crystal', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'performance tests', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'preclinical evaluation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'success', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment strategy', 'visual performance', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,"AFASCI, INC.",R41,2015,233235,2183236,-0.07923251662232493
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,77607041,-0.0014222046557351663
"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.              ",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,8936078,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,235630,5488393,-0.02679145815350062
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,276703803,0.00757864820681294
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.            ",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9072725,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2015,299984,7208224,0.0022709530911867513
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,90710179,-0.01561554367736314
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,570146095,0.0027499997633814604
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,338121506,-0.013890996986021089
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8774800,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2014,73173,338121506,-0.008044325254967673
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays  Project Summary. This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of fea- tures, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combina- tion of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penal- ization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools available for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.            ",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8647816,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2014,131071,0,-0.028809162464677244
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0,0.0007793530245982587
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research     DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.            ",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8828979,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2014,155674,228951281,-0.009809961399988892
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,30434536,-0.05213887851579743
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8775015,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,209258,560644462,0.01030879834731062
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,304670088,-0.02598502564912076
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8635902,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,257300,533302350,-0.0042724011875800594
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,570146095,0.0027499997633814604

"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,0,-0.0028711108098380283
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8484438,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,202118,570146095,0.006396016767202932
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,90710179,-0.01561554367736314
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI  A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.                ",A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI,8648234,R43EB018232,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Bypass', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lumbar spinal cord structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outpatients', 'Painless', 'Paralysed', 'Paraplegia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Part', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'design', 'human subject', 'human subject protection', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'injured', 'life time cost', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'theranostics', 'tool', 'transcutaneous stimulation']",NIBIB,"NEUROENABLING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2013,346207,0,-0.014069422922357947
"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.            ",A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition,8521782,R43NS083098,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bradykinesia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Essential Tremor', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Writing', 'advanced system', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel therapeutics', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2013,424766,1532918,-0.0034378950820089017
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),8468005,U01HL101456,"['Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine', 'Aspirate substance', 'Beds', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'County Hospitals', 'Cysteine', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Erythrocytes', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Free Radicals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Ornithine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrointestinal', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'oxidant stress', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'urea cycle']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2013,519792,199779478,-0.02525565707057847
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8471822,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,224100,570146095,0.006396016767202932
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),8278690,U01HL101456,"['Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine', 'Aspirate substance', 'Beds', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'County Hospitals', 'Cysteine', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Erythrocytes', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Free Radicals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Ornithine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrointestinal', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'oxidant stress', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'urea cycle']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2012,546000,117374875,-0.02525565707057847
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8190163,K99LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2011,89802,570146095,0.00599937937041098
"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,8115129,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,136978,17640378,0.012867915837414085
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,8144459,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2011,147161,511185245,0.008676821737259607
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"PATHOLOGY MISS RATE RISK REDUCTION IN DIAGNOSTIC SMALL BOWEL CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Well trained, experienced gastroenterologists in academic and high volume settings can reliably recognize 97% of pathologies in Capsule Endoscopy (CE) video. However, community physicians and infrequent users may miss up to 20%. The end goal of our proposed new line of research is to develop clinical software that provides automatic decision support to physicians who are trying to declare that a patient is pathology free or has a certain disease process. The risk for the physician - and their patients - is that of a less than optimal clinical outcome due to:  1) missing a lesion/pathology in the video and putting the patient at risk of developing a more serious condition over time, or  2) mistakenly ""identifying"" a pathology that is not present and thus subjecting the patient to unnecessary further diagnostic or surgical procedures.  The research aims in this proposal will enable Ikona to create a pathology prioritization image processing module. Implementing modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Adaboost methodologies together with proprietary image feature analysis, this technology will assign a probability metric to every frame in the image sequence for specific pathology (lesions, ulcers, bleeding, etc) and the major landmarks in the GI tract (ileo-cecal valve, pyloric valve etc.). Filtering and sorting endoscopy image data will be done such that the images with the highest probability of containing pathology will be presented to the reviewer first.  This pathology prioritized sequencing is not intended to replace the clinician in the workflow, but rather to allow the clinician to focus more time on frames with a higher potential of containing pathology. Often times, clinically significant pathology may only be present in a single frame. A single ""pathological"" frame in the middle of a 50,000 frame sequence can easily be overlooked by a novice reviewer or a reviewer whose attention is temporarily distracted. With our proposed pathology prioritization, that single pathological frame will be identified and sorted near the beginning of the image sequence thus greatly increasing the likelihood of detection by the reviewer.  Specifically for Phase I, we plan to investigate and develop different algorithms for classifying image frames and recognizing pathological and normal frames, and, algorithms for ranking frames by severity of pathology. Following the implementation of a working prototype, we will further test the clinical utility of these algorithms with human clinical capsule endoscopy videos.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Experienced gastroenterologists miss 2-3% of pathologies in part due to fatigue from reviewing 50,000 frames per CE video. Less experienced reviewers miss up to 20%. We propose to reduce the risk of false negatives by developing clinical image processing software to automatically re-order the CE video frames, ranking them by the probability they contain pathology.           Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,8139754,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2011,219694,2237141,-0.03416015085705987
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach No abstract available  Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system. The achievement of these aims will result in computer systems that can extract the meaning from free text medical records so researchers, policy makers, and clinicians can use health analytics to improve healthcare.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Natural language processing (NLP) has been successful in extracting specific findings and diagnoses from free text medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8056227,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,177422,558628098,0.0032179302677743716
"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits. Qualitatively, the project should make providing healthcare a more enjoyable experience for all involved, given the reduction of administrative time on the part of the highly skilled clinical staff.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities. Currently, creating that documentation requires a manual, and time-consuming process, which reduces the amount of time clinicians spend with patients, and increases the possibility of data errors. We propose to build a machine learning-based software system that can automatically generate the required clinical documentation, thereby saving time and reducing errors, which will improve the overall quality of patient care.              PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7911700,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2010,226559,2237141,-0.03416015085705987
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,12471676,0.012494049030441165
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7784533,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,341606,558628098,0.0032179302677743716
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7933715,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,388462,17640378,0.012867915837414085
"Accessible Handling of Misclassified or Missing Binary Variables in CER Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common but often overlooked threats to the validity of comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies include the misclassification or missingness of binary variables that are crucial to the ultimate analysis of the data. These variables potentially include the outcome of interest in standard or repeated measures logistic regression models, the factor (exposure) of interest, or an important confounder of the association under study. This proposal seeks to facilitate the investigation of the resulting biases to which a given CER analysis may be subject, and to provide study design-based remedial measures via which validity can be restored. The focus is upon statistical methods for conducting sensitivity analyses, as well as methods designed to make efficient use of supplemental data sources. The latter include validation data (in the case of misclassification), and so-called reassessment data (in the case of potentially informative missingness). A primary consideration throughout includes the incorporation of subject-specific covariates into the model of interest, as well as into models for the underlying misclassification or missingness process. Another primary goal is to establish a relatively consistent likelihood-based framework for all proposed analyses incorporating supplemental data, and to provide user-friendly programs utilizing common statistical software in order to make the methods broadly and readily accessible to those conducting CER. While not limited to specific applications, the proposed research draws motivation from and lends itself to illustration via two real-world studies. The first is the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS), an observational cohort study in which the binary diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made at repeated visits via both error-prone and sophisticated assay techniques. The second is an emergency department-based ophthalmologic study in which non-dilated ocular fundus photography will be used for diagnosing serious ocular conditions, and will be compared against existing standard diagnostic methods. Both studies involve internal validation data to facilitate corrections for misclassification based on a fallible diagnostic method, and both are also subject to missing outcome and/or predictor data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis. The problems upon which the project focuses come about when binary (""yes/no"") data are subject to being incorrectly measured (misclassified), or when they are sometimes not observed (missing) for reasons that might relate to information about subjects in the study. The intention is to provide CER investigators with methods that are relatively easy to use, yet effective and powerful for combating these challenges to valid data analysis.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis.

"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7937047,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2010,493567,178185562,-0.02257488788045785
"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7877057,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,771496,673201228,-0.004244878579819956
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7902293,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease patient registry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'development policy', 'economic cost', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2010,889184,148927,-0.0408490375456877

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7908950,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,17240,340417756,-0.007392692883190993

"Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2001-2003 there were 11.6 million annual ambulatory care visits for skin and soft tissue infections, with a 31% increase in emergency department visits compared to the previous decade, according to the National Hospital AmbulatoryMedical Care Survey data. The majority of these infections are caused by community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and most CA-MRSA infections are manifested as skin and soft tissue infections. As the prevalence of CA-MRSA continues to increase worldwide each year, with community outbreaks observed in multiple settings, it is not surprising that more and more hospitals are being affected by this surge in patient visits. Pediatric and general emergency departments are often the first line for diagnosis and treatment of these infections which may include a painful drainage procedure. A history and physical examination by a health care provider has thus far been the standard of care in diagnosing skin and soft tissue infections. At times inaccurate, the clinical exam can lead to misdiagnosing (either over or underestimating) a lesion that requires drainage. Emergency ultrasound (EUS) is a commonly used tool in general emergency departments for various diagnosis and treatments including the diagnosis of drainable soft tissue infections. The utility of EUS as an adjunct to the clinical examination in pediatric patients for soft tissue infections is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination alone with that of the exam plus EUS in children. This will be done through a cross-sectional study design conducted in a large, urban, tertiary-care pediatric emergency department. Children with suggestion of soft tissue infection will be prospectively enrolled. Physicians are trained in bedside emergency ultrasound for evaluation of soft tissue infections prior to patient enrollment. The reference standard is the presence of a soft tissue infection requiring drainage defined as purulent material expressed if a drainage procedure is performed, or if no drainage is performed, the need for a drainage procedure or spontaneous drainage within two days of the initial visit. Sample size calculations are based upon a hypothesized change in sensitivity of at least 9% with the addition of EUS. Statistical analysis will include calculation of test characteristics, conditional logistic regression with model building, and derivation of ROC curves. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise in visits for soft tissue infections is an important public health issue today. Emergency bedside ultrasound in children may offer improvement in the diagnosis of these infections, and therefore, ultimately may result in more rapid and appropriate treatment, with improved patient outcomes.                 n/a",Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections,7674987,F32AI080063,"['4 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drainage procedure', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'base', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'tertiary care', 'tool']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,F32,2009,61611,178185562,-0.0416939745267139
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7921317,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease patient registry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'development policy', 'economic cost', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2009,118469,148927,-0.0408490375456877
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,7693117,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2009,145926,511185245,0.008676821737259607
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7908952,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'meetings', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2009,170662,7946311,-0.03357288322040696
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7789943,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,177750,28950322,0.0018040704952705297
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,246330700,0.0059027184652860765
"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7692268,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2009,228847,2237141,-0.03416015085705987
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7612766,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2009,342967,12471676,0.012494049030441165
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7690941,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'meetings', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2009,351549,7946311,-0.03357288322040696

Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,558628098,0.0032179302677743716
"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7786337,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,362692,17640378,0.012867915837414085

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,178185562,-0.02257488788045785
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7567140,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,953185,673201228,-0.004244878579819956
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7684273,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease patient registry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'development policy', 'economic cost', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2009,1039667,148927,-0.0408490375456877
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7688793,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,58299,570146095,-0.0010090419751969154
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7480255,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2008,89733,807432003,-0.026239261104210175
"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project described in this grant application is designed to create a new, more efficient and effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/AIDS and other disease, using a fully automated software system. Using modern data mining techniques (pattern recognition, feature recognition, image analysis) we will design software which will analyze data (the cell samples from patients) at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. Objectives: Assemble and validate algorithms in software that can automatically classify regions of interest in flow cytometry data. We will demonstrate that the particular populations required by our use cases can be validly, rigorously and repeatably identified automatically. Develop and validate graphical and statistical results that satisfy FDA requirements for medical device software, simplify regulatory compliance by the clinical user, and automatically deliver analysis results to diagnostic expert systems and/or LIMS systems. Satisfy the  translational medicine  goals outlined in the NIH Roadmap. This software will bring the clinician streamlined testing currently only available in research labs. Methods: Four use cases have been selected, one employing synthetic data and three clinical data; Leukemia/Lymphoma test, Analysis of longitudinal Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) in bone marrow transplant specimens for predictive markers and HIV/AIDS - Gag-specific T cell cytokine response profile assay. For each we have access to a substantial body of existing data, analyzed by experts. Beginning with the autogating routines in our own FlowJo software, we will test and expand the application of Magnetic gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using a sampling of human operators to establish a control range, we will test each of these five techniques against the four use cases in cooperation with our collaborators. Events in the manually classified samples are given a weighted score based on the frequency with which they are included by all the operators. A single operator's score or the gating algorithm's score is compared with the cumulative score of the expert group and a match rating is computed. Additional validation techniques include combinatory validation on internal measures with respect to Pareto optimality, and Predictive Power/Stability self consistency checks using resampled or perturbed data measured with external indices such as the adjusted Rand index and the Variation of Information index.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By eliminating the operator's time, we estimate that the cost of clinical flow cytometry analysis can be reduced to half the current figure while delivering the results much faster. By eliminating the subjectivity and human error of manually created regions and reducing the range of variability of the so created, there would result fewer false positives and false negatives, improving the clinical outcome for those patients needing therapy but undetected by current methods. An order of magnitude increase in speed means faster therapeutic intervention.  A less expensive test improves outcome by making the test accessible to more patients.          n/a",Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating,7482923,R43RR024094,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gagging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NCRR,"TREE STAR, INC.",R43,2008,100854,0,-0.026429723502313332

Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Our goal is to produce software for the analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies to enable researchers who are dependent on computational tools to have the ability to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data.          n/a",Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing,7748401,R44GM083965,"['Learning', 'Techniques', 'parallel computing']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R44,2008,143361,0,0.007039056244854769
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7688756,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Elevation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'development policy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'patient registry', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2008,219307,148927,-0.0408490375456877
"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7388324,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'concept', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2008,228847,2237141,-0.03416015085705987
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7579478,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Count', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Pliability', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice based research', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Score', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,299619,340417756,-0.007392692883190993
"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets). The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7433931,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2008,322087,511185245,-0.023523648513356265
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7354450,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiology, Other', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'transposon/insertion element', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2008,342967,12471676,0.012494049030441165
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,7946311,-0.03357288322040696
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,246330700,0.0059027184652860765

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7458835,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,503603,570146095,-0.0010090419751969154
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7502172,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Elevation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'development policy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'patient registry', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2008,987473,148927,-0.0408490375456877
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,228951281,0.006347664244279205

"Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cryosurgery has been known as an invasive surgical technique since 1961, when Cooper and Lee invented the first cryoprobe. In the 1990s, new developments in Joule-Thomson cooling (the cooling effect associated with a sudden relief of a pressurized gas) led to a dramatic decrease in the size of cryoprobes and an increase in the number of cryoprobes that could be used simultaneously. A dozen or more cryoprobes operating simultaneously in a single prostate cryosurgery is already common practice. If localized effectively, one of the primary benefits of using a large number of miniaturized cryoprobes is superior control over the freezing process.   Currently, the process of selecting the correct placement of the cryoprobes for a specific procedure is an art held by the cryosurgeon, based on the surgeon's own experience and rules of thumb. Cryoprobes are typically operated in a trial-and-error fashion, until the entire target volume is thought to be frozen. Currently, there are no means to determine the optimal locations for the cryoprobes. Suboptimal cryoprobe localization may leave regions in the target volume unfrozen, may lead to cryoinjury of healthy surrounding tissues, may require an unnecessarily large number of cryoprobes, may increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and may increase the likelihood of post cryosurgery complications, all of which affect the quality and cost of the medical treatment. Computerized planning tools would help to alleviate these difficulties.   The ""cryoheater,"" a new device for cryosurgery control has recently been presented by the research team. The cryoheater is a temperature controlled electrical heater. In broad terms, cryoheaters can dramatically increase the ability to control the shape and size of the frozen region, however, to achieve the full benefits of cryoheaters, computerized planning tools for cryoheater localization are necessary.   Our goal is to develop computerized planning tools for cryosurgery that are suitable for all available cooling techniques. The proposed research includes: (1) Development of an efficient numerical scheme for bioheat transfer simulations of cyroprocedures, (2) Development of an efficient optimization technique based on a force-field analogy. (3) Development of knowledge-based optimization techniques. (4) Experimental verification of the planning tool.       Besides planning, another important application of the proposed tool is the training of cryosurgeons. The proposed tool will provide cryosurgeons with the ability to visualize the 3D volumetric nature of the freezing process.   Likewise, it will allow the surgeon to explore the performance of various configurations of cryoprobes and cryoheaters, and observe the defects that would result from each. Such visualization capabilities will provide surgeons with insights into the physics of cryosurgery that are difficult to obtain from physical experiments or surgical practice.         n/a",Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning,7210691,R01EB003563,"['Affect', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Catheters', 'Computational Technique', 'Condition', 'Cool-X-A', 'Cryosurgery', 'Defect', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Europe', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Furuncles', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modems', 'Nature', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Placement', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thinking', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experience', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'thermal seeds', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,87443,30434536,-0.014509082872968973
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7298516,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2007,88539,807432003,-0.026239261104210175
"SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment The phase I objective of SPIMA is to create a phone-based system that longitudinally and remotely assesses the mood of patients suffering from major depression. The ultimate objective of this SBIR is to automate the assessment of depression and deliver that automated assessment remotely over telecommunications or internet infrastructure. The value of the system is for patients and providers to have an unobtrusive way to gain greater insight into the progression of depression, and potential response to therapy. The core technology is the SPIMA index that is calculated based on performing signal processing of voice acoustics and will correlate to standard clinical depression rating scales. The phase I will begin with a first user study to give use case scenarios on the design of SPIMA and collect 150 voice samples from 30 subjects. The voice algorithms will be tested for reliability on these diverse voice samples. Through a second study of fifteen depressed patients over eight weeks, the SPIMA index will be validated. The objective of that study will be to establish the overall feasibility of SPIMA to predict a patient's mood and response to medical therapy over time. In the phase II study, SPIMA will be validated with a larger patient population through a phase IV clinical trial. It will also be applied to run off a mobile phone as a step towards more continuous mood monitoring. The project is significant as it can provide a new means to manage this chronic and debilitating disease. SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment SPIMA will make a significant impact on public health by providing a simple and elegant way to monitor depression through voice analysis. The SPIMA index will become an important longitudinal measure of a patient's mood that will be closely related to established depression rating scales. This innovation will ultimately equip the patient and care provider with information to better manage major depression.          n/a",SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment,7326946,R43MH079573,"['Acoustics', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endogenous depression', 'Evaluation', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family Practice', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Week', 'Workplace', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mecarzole', 'response']",NIMH,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2007,123893,662886,-0.0033559835088636508
"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,558628098,-0.0026793907636312054
"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,16827427,0.001924404144873444

"Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Diagnosing a patient's condition and predicting the patient's outcomes are critical activities in clinical care. The better these activities can be performed, the better the patient's healthcare results are likely to be. Similarly, efficient use of healthcare resources depends upon being able to determine accurately when and where a resource is likely to be useful, which also involves making predictions. Even modest improvements in predictive accuracy can at times have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Thus, for both individual patients and for society at large, making accurate healthcare predictions is an important task.      There is a clear trend toward having more and more patient data that is available electronically in healthcare information systems and in databases of clinical research studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to construct evidence-based predictive models from these data sources. Indeed, numerous clinical prediction models have already been constructed. Typically, a single prediction model has been induced from the data, and then applied -- as relevant -- to each future patient. Such a population-wide model is constructed to try to optimize its average predictive performance on all future patient cases to which it is applied. Model induction does not take advantage of information about the patient case at hand, which could potentially enhance the form and content of the model that is constructed.      The current project will investigate methods that construct patient-specific models that are sensitive to information about the patient at hand. These new methods will be evaluated for their performance in predicting patient outcomes in the diverse domains of sepsis, heart failure and substance use disorders. A variety of current population-wide model-construction methods, including logistic regression and neural networks, will serve as controls.      If patient-specific models can improve upon the predictive performance of population-wide models, as seems plausible, the added performance is likely to provide substantial benefit as a component of future computer-based decision-support systems for clinical care. n/a",Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data,7185137,R01LM008374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Societies', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,278631,570146095,-0.007398120248471053

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets). The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7244058,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,328325,511185245,-0.023523648513356265
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,558628098,0.0059027184652860765

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,7946311,-0.03357288322040696
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrometest characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CMcode groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndromedefinitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly. n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7428896,R01PH000038,[' '],PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2007,415565,399166773,-0.004504832307969141
"Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Yet melanoma can be easily cured if detected early. Digital dermoscopy has shown promise for more accurate detection, particularly at an early stage. Recent conferences have highlighted a general agreement on definition of dermoscopic features and moderate agreement on the most useful structural features. Automatic detection of these specific structures that are critical for early diagnosis and are used in various dermoscopic diagnostic algorithms would be desirable. Yet little work has been published on automatic detection of any specific dermoscopic structures. Although specific colors figure prominently in the definition of the most critical dermoscopic structures, little work has been done on finding the specific regions or region combinations in the color space where colors are located, particularly with reference to the surrounding skin. The work in Phase I and after Phase I successfully segmented the border within 5% of the range of the dermatologists' borders, found several highly accurate dermoscopy features, and brought mean diagnostic accuracy on difficult early lesions to a high level. This proposal seeks to develop a digital dermosocopy system by 1) comparing classifiers 2) testing border accuracy and modifying segmentation if needed 3) developing an algorithm that uses a three-dimensional representation of a probability density function to specify single and paired melanoma colors via cluster methods and fuzzy logic techniques 4) identifying critical structural features including brown globules, abrupt border cutoff, granularity, regression, and pigment asymmetry with high accuracy 5) developing a clinical interface for acquisition of images within the clinic 6) testing the new algorithms in six dermatology clinics including two pigmented lesion clinics with both EpiLight and DermLite II Pro dermoscopy images taken in the clinic. Key features of the research include dermatopathology confirmation of specific structures and the use of relative color analysis. If successful, software will be marketed to the growing number of dermatologists with digital dermoscopy capability. The commercial software package will be ready for marketing as a diagnostic adjunct for digital camera dermoscopy attachments. Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Melanoma can be easily cured if detected early, and this project seeks to develop a digital dermoscopy device that can detect very early melanomas. The project goal is to develop inexpensive melanoma detection software and test it in multiple dermatology clinics.          n/a",Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis,7284886,R44CA101639,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Am 80', 'Amelanotic Melanoma', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Borderline Lesion', 'Boxing', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Cicatrix', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Count', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Dysplastic Nevus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Hair', 'Hair Removal', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Lentigo', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'N(delta)-acetylornithine, -isomer', 'N-dodecanoylglutamic acid, -isomer, sodium salt', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Pigments', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'ROC Curve', 'Radial', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Work', 'alpha-difluoromethyl-DOPA, -isomer', 'alpha-methylornithine dihydrochloride, -isomer', 'base', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'melanoma', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool development', 'vector']",NCI,STOECKER & ASSOCIATES,R44,2007,494442,0,-0.030649544528041833
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,673201228,0.013129329266980676
"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7427364,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Elevation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'development policy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'patient registry', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,GROUP HEALTH COOPERATIVE,U01,2007,970601,0,-0.0408490375456877
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,7287568,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2006,38558,0,-0.014092715234855042
"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7124706,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2006,135000,558628098,-0.0026793907636312054
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7140644,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,182119,0,0.001662955717899822
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,7109311,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"CHATTEN ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2006,400929,0,5.599920008891592e-05
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,558628098,-0.006563225523598342
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,673201228,0.013129329266980676

"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined.

Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,6958394,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2005,134800,558628098,-0.0026793907636312054
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0,0.001662955717899822
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,6910621,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2005,245768,0,-0.014092715234855042
"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,6993754,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"ASTRO-MED, INC.",R44,2005,306142,0,5.599920008891592e-05
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serve CDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections Preventive Service, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrome test characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CM code groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndrome definitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly.  n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7097771,R01PH000038,"['artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'emergency health services', 'emerging infectious disease', 'environmental health', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'informatics', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2005,412947,399166773,-0.0050633054683565095
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6912634,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,478937,558628098,-0.006563225523598342
"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6917854,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,593264,673201228,0.013129329266980676
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6930547,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2005,594222,232986943,-0.0007823850418814001

"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,228951281,0.006705458568831967
"Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR aims to produce next generation classification and regression software based upon ensembles of decision trees: bagging, random forests, and boosting. The prediction accuracy of these methods has caused much excitement in the machine learning community, and both challenges and complements the data modeling culture prevalent among biostatisticians. Recent research extends the methodology to likelihood based methods used in biostatistics, leading to models for survival data and generalized forest models. Generalized forest models extend regression forests in the same way that generalized linear models extend linear models.      This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, prognostic modeling, and detecting cancer; and for modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure, discrete responses in clinical trials, and count data.      Phase I work will prototype software for survival data, and investigate the performance of ensemble methods on simulated and real data. For survival applications, we will assess out-of-bag estimates of performance, and investigate measures of variable importance and graphics that help clinicians understand the results. Experience writing prototypes and using them on data will lead to a preliminary software design that serves as the foundation of Phase II work.      Phase II will expand upon this work to create commercial software. We will research and implement algorithms for a wider range of applications including generalized forest models, classification, and least squares regression. We will also implement robust loss criteria that enable good performance on noisy data, and make adaptations to handle large data sets.      This proposed software will enable medical researchers to obtain high prediction accuracy, and complement traditional tools like discriminant analysis, linear and logistic regression models, and the Cox model.         n/a",Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods,6832086,R43CA105724,"['clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer remission /regression', 'prognosis', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2004,99937,0,0.0006136325003161002
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6780874,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', 'age difference', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'newborn human (0-6 weeks)', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2004,194888,31980265,-0.00375589382825736
"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,0,-0.018688480141081844
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6781785,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,468590,558628098,-0.006563225523598342
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6749459,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,594553,673201228,0.013129329266980676
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6800057,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2004,607174,232986943,-0.0007823850418814001

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6558664,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', ' clinical research', ' data collection', ' health science research', ' human data', ' informatics', ' library', ' medical records', ' molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,464049,558628098,-0.006563225523598342
"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,673201228,0.013129329266980676
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6673408,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disasters', ' disease outbreaks', ' early diagnosis', ' geographic site', ' human data', ' human population study', ' public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2003,606068,232986943,-0.0007823850418814001
"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,533302350,0.008159189112425733
"Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase I application proposes to extend an existing multi-tier Internet client-server system (""CliniMetricar"") by integrating active diagnostic logic.  CliniMetrica currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). CliniMetrica automatically indexes digital audio recording of assessment interviews, and was developed with SBIR support from NIMH Digital video functions are currently being implemented and tested with additional NIMH support, as are functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers.  The CliniMetrica system is increasing in sophistication and functionality, and has applications for clinical research (e.g., clinical trials) as well as for more routine clinical practice.  The current lack of fully developed and tested diagnostic functionality is a major gap.  A number of potential customers have requested integrated DSM-IV and/or lCD-10 diagnostic results to be automatically linked to assessments.  In order to meet this market need, we propose to implement the DSM-IV and ICD-10 nosologic systems as two classification knowledge bases that a logic engine will process to generate diagnostic results.  These logical functions are difficult to implement and manipulate with procedural languages (e. g. C + +). so the use of a logic engine provides significant technical benefits.  This diagnostic logic version of CliniMetrica is referred to as ""CliniMetrica-Dx.""  To assist raters in thorough examination and to support adaptive assessment, a user interface coupled to logic processing modules will allow tracking the diagnostic status of a subject (the sets of true, false, partially true, or partially false DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses during assessment.  The logic engine will dynamically generate assessment item subsets (currently from the SCAN) needed to rule-in or rule-out DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses. During the assessment, presentation of these symptom sets to the assessor can further guide the interview. By narrowing the ""search space,"" the efficiency of assessments will be increased. By formalizing the search, reliability and validity can be enhanced In addition, to provide support for nosologic research and development, in Phase II the system will include mappings between DSM-IV and lCD-10, and between current and future versions of the DSM and lCD.  The CliniMetrica-Dx system as an application framework will generalize to other clinical psychiatric assessment instruments such as the SCID, to adaptive self-report systems, and to other medical specialties.  It also will have applications for education and training.   n/a",Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry,6549963,R43MH066434,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' indexing', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICAL DECISION LOGIC, INC.",R43,2002,94169,290832,-0.007792990086385821
"Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this Phase I project is to test the feasibility of a computerized diagnostic tool for collaborative assessment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.  Such a system is sorely needed in both clinical and research settings because (a) structured clinical interviews, although the gold standard in diagnosis, are time consuming and underutilized, and (b) the clinical judgment that is often substituted is of Limited accuracy and subject to several significant biases.  Using the diagnostic rules from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the proposed product will provide clinicians with automated actuarial symptom and diagnostic data thereby circumventing these limitations while assisting the collaborative diagnostic process.  These goals will be accomplished by integrating a reliable and valid symptom checklist filled out by patient informants with an advanced rule-based documentation system that employs an established logic-processing engine and which utilizes the complete DSM-IV rule set.  Based on the presence and severity of discrete symptoms, clinicians will be provided with actuarially derived probability values that indicate the likelihood of specific DSM-IV criteria or disorders.  Additionally, it will facilitate rapid and complete documentation DSM-IV criterion necessary to formally validate or refute diagnoses.  The improved integration of client and clinician information will provide increased diagnostic precision and facilitate collaboration between providers and clients.  In Phase II, the system will be extended to support repeated assessment, direct access via the World Wide Web, and larger sampling to collect further psychometric information.  Phase I objectives include: 1. To produce a highly usable collaborative diagnostic assessment tool that will be used by individual practitioners, small group practices and their clients.  2. To automate the determination of the positive and negative predictive power of informant symptom data for corresponding DSM-IV criterion and diagnoses, and to collect an initial data set to evaluate usability and psychometric properties of the system.  Phase II objectives include: (1) creation of a user interfaces and program logic to support repeated assessment (2) scaling to provide direct access via the World Wide Web and (3) larger sampling to extend the known psychometric properties of the system.

"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.   n/a",Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification,6555484,R43AI052944,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' communicable disease diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' microorganism', ' nucleic acid denaturation', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' phase change', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NIAID,IDAHO TECHNOLOGY,R43,2002,100000,0,-0.006313524035057892
"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications. Work in Phase II will extend the framework and develop two-demonstration applications--computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammography and multimodality image fusion. The ultimate goal is to obtain key partnerships and the private equity investment necessary for commercialization, which will proceed by launching revenue-generating versions of the CAD and image fusion applications. n/a",Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications,6494576,R44EB000149,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' mathematics', ' positron emission tomography', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,"FRONTIER MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2002,143577,0,-0.025523190532808455
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6529026,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2002,193637,31980265,-0.00375589382825736
"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses.

"Development of Ultrasonic Apparatus for Dental Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION: Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed (Phases 1 and 2)      for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as                     demineralization, caries, fractures, abscesses, and tooth wear. The equipment        adopts piezoelectric and optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation on       teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will then be analyzed by a        pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the         diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to      reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinic and also contribute       to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. In the Phase 1 research, tooth           specimens will be collected from local Dental clinics; demonstration                 instrumentation will be constructed; ultrasonic testing will be conducted on         the tooth specimens in vitro; and finally, the test data will be analyzed to         show the potential for Dental pathology identification. The feasibility of the       proposed research concept will be demonstrated, if: 1) meaningful ultrasonic         tests can be conducted using the simple piezo-/opto-ultrasonic system on the         tooth specimens collected; 2) various Dental pathologies in the tooth specimens      may be characterized by using wave pattern of the ultrasonic responses; and 3)       by identifying particular features of an ultrasonic wave pattern, the actual         tooth pathology may be recognized.

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events. Successful completion of the training and research program will allow Dr. Ayappa to contribute independently to research in the field of sleep physiology. n/a",Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing,6320670,K25HL004420,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' breath tests', ' cardiopulmonary disease', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' electrocardiography', ' electroencephalography', ' electromyography', ' electrooculography', ' human subject', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' patient oriented research', ' polysomnography', ' respiratory airflow disorder', ' respiratory airflow measurement', ' respiratory disorder diagnosis', ' sleep disorders']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K25,2001,147450,329565273,-0.010880636081485607
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6383999,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2001,200999,31980265,-0.00375589382825736
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER   Skin cancer is the fastest growing cancer. Approximately 34,100         Americans developed cutaneous melanoma in 1995; of the survivors, many must          contend with the ongoing trauma of disfigurement and fear. Skin biopsies are         now the most frequently performed medical procedure. It is axiomatic among           dermatologists that early detection and diagnosis are critical. Great strides        have been made in early detection of suspect skin lesions; however failure to        biopsy the right lesion has severe consequences. The dilemma is exacerbated          since 50- 80 percent of biopsies prove unnecessary, contributing to an enormous      waste of health care dollars, patient trauma and negative patient behavior           feedback. The Phase I work in dermatological spectroscopy and artificial neural      net technology suggest that an automated clinical diagnostic aid which produces      a quantitative rather than qualitative diagnostic assessment of skin lesions is      possible. This project proposes development and testing of such a product.           During Phase II a large number of spectroscopic samples of melanoma and nevi         will be used to complete development of an artificial neural net classifier.

Skin biopsies are now the most frequently performed reimbursed Medicare procedure,   and as many as 50-80% are found not to be necessary after the fact.  The low cost of   this test, and rapid amortization of the system, coupled with the enormous health care   cost savings possible in conjunction with a significant and widely recognized health   problem, suggest that this product could have great commercial potential.  n/a",A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER,6376769,R44CA078006,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence spectrometry', ' histology', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' reflection spectrometry', ' skin neoplasms', ' spectrometry']",NCI,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R44,2001,359255,0,-0.035167958316248894

"ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC FOR PSYCHIATRY   DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): This Phase I project          proposes to assess the feasibility of an advanced diagnostic logic system            (Diagnostica) to support the clinical assessment process for diagnosis in            psychiatry. A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0,0.00048340191480335715
"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0,-0.010552697433646495
"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,533302350,0.008159189112425733
"NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Receiver Operating             Characteristic (ROC) analysis is recognized widely as the best way of            measuring and specifying the accuracies of diagnostic procedures, because it     is able to distinguish between actual differences in discrimination              capacity, on one hand, and apparent differences that are due only to             decision-threshold effects, on the other.  Key methodological needs remain       to be satisfied before ROC analysis can address all of the practically           important situations that arise in diagnostic applications, however.

"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER Many primary care physicians are unable to proficiently triage skin lesions suspicious for cancer, compromising patients' health. Decision support software could help in the early detection of skin cancer, decreasing morbidity and mortality related to skin cancer misdiagnoses. It also could reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists, lowering health care costs. In Phase I, we demonstrated that decision support software can significantly improve physicians' ability to arrive at appropriate triage decisions for a variety skin lesions, including cancerous lesions. In Phase II, we propose to l) expand the decision support software to triage for pigmented lesions and a wider range of nonpigmented skin lesions; 2) incorporate case-based reasoning methods into the software to enable users to conduct a confidence check on their final triage decision and to help them make the correct decision at each branch point in the decision tree; 3) develop a teaching application based on the decision tree; 4) enable the software to produce for patients individualized information on skin cancer prevention and treatment; 5) interface the decision support software with the computerized patient medical record; and 6) test the effectiveness, utility, and feasibility of the decision support software with a sample of primary care physicians and patients.

"A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER   Skin cancer is the fastest growing cancer. Approximately 34,100         Americans developed cutaneous melanoma in 1995; of the survivors, many must          contend with the ongoing trauma of disfigurement and fear. Skin biopsies are         now the most frequently performed medical procedure. It is axiomatic among           dermatologists that early detection and diagnosis are critical. Great strides        have been made in early detection of suspect skin lesions; however failure to        biopsy the right lesion has severe consequences. The dilemma is exacerbated          since 50- 80 percent of biopsies prove unnecessary, contributing to an enormous      waste of health care dollars, patient trauma and negative patient behavior           feedback. The Phase I work in dermatological spectroscopy and artificial neural      net technology suggest that an automated clinical diagnostic aid which produces      a quantitative rather than qualitative diagnostic assessment of skin lesions is      possible. This project proposes development and testing of such a product.           During Phase II a large number of spectroscopic samples of melanoma and nevi         will be used to complete development of an artificial neural net classifier.         Such a classifier system will lead to a commercial product to discriminate           ""normal,"" pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed project will lead to a non-invasive, in-office, real-time test to provide an  automated, repeatable diagnostic probability of the nature of skin lesions prior to biopsy.  Skin biopsies are now the most frequently performed reimbursed Medicare procedure,   and as many as 50-80% are found not to be necessary after the fact.  The low cost of   this test, and rapid amortization of the system, coupled with the enormous health care   cost savings possible in conjunction with a significant and widely recognized health   problem, suggest that this product could have great commercial potential.  n/a",A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER,6143548,R44CA078006,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence spectrometry', ' histology', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' reflection spectrometry', ' skin neoplasms', ' spectrometry']",NCI,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R44,2000,363073,0,-0.035167958316248894

It is proposed to develop knowledge files for the     grading of solar lesions, for the analysis of prostatic intraepithelial          neoplastic lesions (PIN), for benign proliferative epithelial lesions of the     breast, and for kidney tumors.  Quantitative progression indices will be         derived from histometric measurements.
