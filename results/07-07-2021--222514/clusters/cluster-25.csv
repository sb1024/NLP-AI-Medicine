"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Translation of a biomarker panel for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma This application proposes to translate our identification of a biomarker panel for hepatocellular carcinoma to commercial and clinical use. We have identified a specific post-translation modification that is altered in HCC. This alteration is a shift in the composition of N-linked glycans found on proteins made in and secreted by HCC cells. Many of the proteins containing this glycan alteration have been identified and patented. Our strong preliminary evidence has shown that some of these proteins, when combined with existing biomarkers and clinical factors, have excellent discriminatory ability between those with HCC and those with cirrhosis. Importantly, our biomarker efforts have focused on the detection of early stage lesions using our current biomarker panel, which is a simple logistic regression algorithm composed of fucosylated kininogen, alpha- fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), age and gender. Called the kininogen panel, it had an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.97 for the differentiation of early stage HCC from cirrhosis. In an independent external validation of this panel, in three independent cohorts this panel had an AUROC of 0.92 to 0.97 in the detection of early stage HCC. Thus our enthusiasm for this biomarker panel is high. To fully understand the clinical and commercial benefits of any biomarker, a large scale clinical validation study that is appropriate powered is essential. Hence, the two goals of this application are to validate the kininogen panel for the detection of early stage HCC at the time of HCC diagnosis (Aim 1) and determine when in time an individual becomes biomarker positive prior to developing HCC (Aim 2). At the completion of these two aims, Glycotest will have validated this biomarker panel and have confidence in its performance. Glycotest's strategy is focused on commercialization of its tests as Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) service products. These tests will be marketed to and ordered by specialists who care for the patient populations at risk for liver cancers and fibrosis-cirrhosis. LDTs are tests developed and run in a single ""CLIA lab"" regulated by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The LDT business model has been used successfully by many other US companies that have commercialized tests as service products in multiple disease areas. The Company will establish an internal selling and marketing capability focused initially on major influential medical centers and key opinion leader sites as well as the west coast and east coast geographical areas, and will pursue a strategy for establishing Medicare reimbursement that it has developed in collaboration with external experts. Narrative: The goal of this proposal is to translate a biomarker for the early detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to clinical and commercial use.

"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9997828,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,645058,685608202,0.2787212561557116
"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9997848,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,791318,641965656,0.3304192100010713
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9646340,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2019,249000,29585825,0.37552715516541985

"The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation. (3) We will perform Phase 2 clinical assay validation and Phase 3 early detection validation for the diagnostic test. (4) We will contribute to the collaborative trans-network activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate a diagnostic test for the early detection of liver cancer.

"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9784773,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,658591,641965656,0.3304192100010713
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9679122,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,680549,685608202,0.2787212561557116
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. This STTR phase II project continues to develop a quantitative imaging biomarker named hepatic tumor viability (HTV) for automated quantification of tumor viability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multi-phase hepatic MDCT images.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9441722,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2018,249000,29585825,0.37552715516541985
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,9512848,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B Therapy', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive service', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'care providers', 'case control', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2018,273336,7292939,0.4095841401789218
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9590246,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,664962,641965656,0.3304192100010713
"The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation. (3) We will perform Phase 2 clinical assay validation and Phase 3 early detection validation for the diagnostic test. (4) We will contribute to the collaborative trans-network activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate a diagnostic test for the early detection of liver cancer. This test could fill an urgent demand to benefit patients, who are in risk of developing liver cancer.",The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer,9590573,U01CA230705,"['African American', 'Age', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Genetic', 'Hispanics', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Viral hepatitis', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'early detection biomarkers', 'exosome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'population based', 'protein metabolite', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'surveillance imaging', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,679208,673201228,0.11213013003063103
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. This STTR phase II project continues to develop a quantitative imaging biomarker named hepatic tumor viability (HTV) for automated quantification of tumor viability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multi-phase hepatic MDCT images.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months.

"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,9297272,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Therapy', 'Hepatitis C', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive service', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'case control', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2017,273336,7292939,0.4095841401789218

"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,98796731,0.33603018404463336
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,8805692,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2015,109620,524978793,0.37552715516541985

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.        Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.

In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.

"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7640849,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'design', 'disease classification', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,207225,50343425,0.26009568744141465
"Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) has doubled in the United States over the past two decades. Hepatitis C is the major risk factor for HCC with approximately 3 million individuals currently infected nationwide. Survival following HCC diagnosis is dismal except where potentially curative therapy (resection, transplant, local ablation) is applied. HCC surveillance is aimed at applying abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosing HCC at an early stage when patients are most likely to be eligible for potentially curative therapy. One randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have indicated that HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved survival. Practice guidelines have recommended HCC surveillance for patients with hepatitis C at high risk of developing HCC. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the extent of prevalence, patterns, and determinants of HCC surveillance. AIMS: (i) To examine the patterns (prevalence, type, and frequency) of utilization of HCC surveillance in veterans infected with hepatitis C; (2) To examine patient-, facility provider-, and physician provider- determinants of HCC surveillance among veterans infected with hepatitis C; and (3) To examine the effect of HCC surveillance on the receipt of HCC potentially curative therapy and survival among veterans infected with hepatitis C, and to identify surveillance strategies associated with best outcomes. METHODS: We propose to conduct i) a retrospective cohort study of more than 150,000 patients infected with hepatitis C and 39,000 high-risk patients identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Registry, 2) a survey of more than 128 provider facilities to supplement information in the registry, and 3) a survey of physician providers to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards HCC surveillance. Surveillance tests will be identified in the registry based on a previously developed algorithm using data from administrative files. Patient-, tumor-, and facility determinants of HCC surveillance will be identifed from the Hepatitis C Registry and supplemented by the facility survey. Additionally, we will examine the association between surveillance and receipt of resection, transplant, or local ablation as well as survival. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to examine these outcomes. IMPACT: This study will examine a previously unaddressed subject pertaining to a highly fatal cancer that thus far has received little attention. It will provide information on the effectiveness of HCC screening as reflected by the extent of use as well as outcomes.

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,50343425,0.3998651000548058
"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7531854,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'disease classification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,172688,50343425,0.26009568744141465
"Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) has doubled in the United States over the past two decades. Hepatitis C is the major risk factor for HCC with approximately 3 million individuals currently infected nationwide. Survival following HCC diagnosis is dismal except where potentially curative therapy (resection, transplant, local ablation) is applied. HCC surveillance is aimed at applying abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosing HCC at an early stage when patients are most likely to be eligible for potentially curative therapy. One randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have indicated that HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved survival. Practice guidelines have recommended HCC surveillance for patients with hepatitis C at high risk of developing HCC. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the extent of prevalence, patterns, and determinants of HCC surveillance. AIMS: (i) To examine the patterns (prevalence, type, and frequency) of utilization of HCC surveillance in veterans infected with hepatitis C; (2) To examine patient-, facility provider-, and physician provider- determinants of HCC surveillance among veterans infected with hepatitis C; and (3) To examine the effect of HCC surveillance on the receipt of HCC potentially curative therapy and survival among veterans infected with hepatitis C, and to identify surveillance strategies associated with best outcomes. METHODS: We propose to conduct i) a retrospective cohort study of more than 150,000 patients infected with hepatitis C and 39,000 high-risk patients identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Registry, 2) a survey of more than 128 provider facilities to supplement information in the registry, and 3) a survey of physician providers to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards HCC surveillance.
