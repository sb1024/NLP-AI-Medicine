"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000,551214295
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865,230060143
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999,228951281
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684,570146095
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893,415711940
"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1466398,560644462
