"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Vitamin D and Breast Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Applicant. This pre-doctoral fellowship (F31) application is designed to promote the training of Joyce Rhoden, a pre-doctoral student in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina. Her goal is to become an independent researcher who conducts innovative, translational health research. During the F31 training the applicant will be mentored by her sponsors Drs. Marilie Gammon and Cathrine Hoyo. Significance. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) result from incomplete combustion and are ubiquitous. Many, but not all, studies show positive associations between PAHs and breast cancer risk. Vitamin D significantly protects against oxidative stress in breast epithelial cells and is associated with lower breast cancer risk. Vitamin D prevents pre-neoplastic lesions in mammary gland explants after exposure to the PAH carcinogen 7,12- dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA). However, no epidemiologic study has examined if associations between PAHs and breast cancer incidence vary with plasma vitamin D or vitamin D polymorphisms. The study hypothesis is that elevated risks for breast cancer incidence associated with PAHs will be evident only in women with low vitamin D levels, or with genotypes that may lower vitamin D levels. Aim 1. Determine if PAH measures (PAH-DNA adducts and PAH sources (active and passive smoking, grilled/smoked foods, indoor fireplace use, vehicular traffic)) interact with plasma 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25-OHD) concentrations to influence breast cancer risk. Aim 2. Determine if PAH measures interact with any of 25 vitamin D-related genetic single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to influence breast cancer incidence. Aim 3. Determine if genetically predicted vitamin D levels influences breast cancer risk and assess whether the genetically predicted vitamin D levels modify the PAH-breast cancer associations. Approach. The dissertation will use existing information from 1508 women with breast cancer and 1556 women without breast cancer. Measures of PAH and vitamin D were assessed shortly after diagnosis. For Aims 1-3, logistic regression will be conducted to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to examine interaction on the multiplicative and additive scales. For Aim 3, an adjusted two-stage least squares regression method will be used to estimate a weighted genetic predictive score, which can then be used in logistic models. Innovation. This dissertation: (1) will be the first epidemiologic study to examine interaction between PAHs and vitamin D in association with breast cancer risk; (2) includes multi-level PAH and vitamin D measures; (3) explores biologically plausible SNPs; (4) will estimate genetically predicted vitamin D levels; and (5) uses a well-characterized population-based sample. Impact. The proposed dissertation may identify a potential low-cost risk reduction strategy for breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many, but not all population studies, have linked PAH sources to the development of breast cancer and inconsistently to survival following breast cancer diagnosis; reasons for the conflicting results are unclear. Vitamin D has been associated with decreased risk of developing breast cancer and may modulate the relationship between PAH exposure and breast cancer. Results from this dissertation may identify a low-cost intervention and improve understanding of the role of environmental exposures in breast cancer development.","Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Vitamin D and Breast Cancer",10065428,F31CA247251,"['Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Apoptosis', 'Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fellowship', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Tumorigenesis', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Passive Smoking', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population Study', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Sun Exposure', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'ambient air pollution', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cigarette smoke', 'cost', 'delta opioid receptor', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'disorder risk', 'doctoral student', 'epidemiology study', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic predictors', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'population based', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'protective effect']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,38062,511185245
"Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon Project Summary/Abstract: As cancer becomes an increasingly important cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, nations must improve their capacity to diagnose and treat the malignancies that most affect their populations. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality for women in Cameroon, where two thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and five-year survival rates are less than 30%. A longstanding collaboration between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles (the MBLA partnership) plans to conduct key stakeholder interviews in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a breast cancer screening program that is initially offered to high-risk women. Risk-based screening aims to equitably target early screening efforts while ensuring that diagnostic and treatment capacity are sufficient to manage lesions identified through screening. Such a program requires a breast cancer risk prediction model that is applicable and acceptable to Cameroonian women and feasible to evaluate through a community-based screening program. Studies in the United States, Asia, and Nigeria demonstrate that breast cancer risk prediction models perform best when they are ethnic group-specific, but no breast cancer risk prediction model has been developed for Cameroonian women. The African Breast Cancer case-control Study (ABCS) contains breast cancer risk factor information for women from Nigeria, Uganda, and a small subset of women from Cameroon. Traditional approaches to risk prediction will likely suffer from small sample size in models trained on Cameroon data only or from bias in models trained and validated on the full, ethnically diverse dataset. In Aim 1, a subgroup-specific cross-validation method will be incorporated into the Super Learner ensemble prediction algorithm to develop a breast cancer risk prediction model that incorporates all ABCS data but is optimized for Cameroonian women. Aim 2 addresses MBLA members’ concerns that certain risk factors from ABCS will be difficult to evaluate by community survey. Targeted learning methods will be used to define metrics for comparing risk prediction models including and excluding these variables so that Cameroonian stakeholders can evaluate whether to include these risk factors in their breast cancer risk prediction model. In Aim 3, an R shiny app will be developed, tested, and optimized in order to facilitate use of a Cameroon-specific breast cancer risk model in a future screening program. The methods developed and tested in this project could help to optimize cancer risk prediction models for other ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of the MBLA collaboration, UC Berkeley’s leaders in the field of targeted learning, and the UCSF Global Cancer Program. By providing protected time for training, research, and career development, this grant will facilitate the applicant’s progress towards becoming a breast surgical oncologist researching methods of improving access to cancer care in Africa. Project Narrative: In response to rising rates of breast cancer in Cameroon, a partnership between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles plans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a risk-based breast cancer screening program in Cameroon. This project aims to develop a method for defining a breast cancer risk prediction model optimized for Cameroonian women that makes use of information from a large, ethnically diverse case-control dataset and to provide Cameroonian stakeholders with information needed to select which risk factors to include in a Cameroon- specific breast cancer risk model. These methods could be used to define optimal cancer risk prediction models for ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally.",Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon,10141952,F32CA257350,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Asians', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cameroon', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Improve Access', 'Incidence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nigeria', 'Nigerian', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Study models', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Oncologist', 'Survival Rate', 'Target Populations', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Uganda', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'breast cancer registry', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'design', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'mortality', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2021,74958,148186688
"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,10159953,K01HL152009,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical care', 'design', 'dieting', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'social', 'survivorship', 'young adult', 'young cancer survivor']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2021,156336,367414121
"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,10104459,R21CA234752,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chest', 'Childhood Cancer Survivor Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Contralateral Breast', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Late Effects', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Induced Cancer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Factor', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological systems', 'cancer genetics', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental radiation', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'proton therapy', 'radiation risk', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2021,167926,185946435
"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,10261485,R21AG064875,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Arthralgia', 'Attention', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Center', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Estrogens', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Tamoxifen', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Vasomotor', 'Woman', 'adjuvant endocrine therapy', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'older patient', 'older women', 'pill', 'poor sleep', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,195000,122662885
"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls. The study will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammograms and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening.",Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening,10165659,R01CA218405,"['Address', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visualization software', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'breast density', 'breast imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,357994,570146095
"Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms Project Summary The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and, therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%) never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus, offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential (≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation. We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT), convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups. Project Narrative There is much controversy surrounding breast cancer screening guidelines, resulting in women making individual choices regarding their screening, in consultation with their physician. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to women as to the benefit of screening mammography for them as an individual. Our research goal is to develop a near-term mammography-detectable breast cancer risk marker using a new image transformation, deep learning, and statistical approach for longitudinal data on serial mammograms that will help women choose their own personalized protocol in consultation with their doctor.",Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms,10174885,R37CA248207,"['Advocate', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radon', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,357994,570146095
"Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries One of the biggest cancer challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the lack of access to accurate and affordable cellular and molecular diagnostics, which are essential for making informed therapeutic decisions, in particular for breast cancer. With the increased use of low cost ultrasound, it has become possible to readily sample suspicious breast lesions with ﬁne needles (ﬁne needle aspirates, FNA). However, the workup of such specimens is often impossible in many LMIC settings. To address these barriers to diagnosis, Aikili—derived from A.I. and Akili (intelligence in Kiswahili)—seeks to enable the same-day diagnosis of breast cancer at the point-of-care using a low-cost, automated system. The Aikili system is a highly advanced stand-alone diagnostic platform capable of automated cancer diagnosis and receptor sub- typing in near real-time (< 1 hour), at a low cost (<$800 for integrated hardware and $5-10 per test). Building upon our initial development and successful clinical validation of human samples, the goal of this Phase I application is to advance the Aikili technology to signiﬁcantly improve its usability in resource-limited settings. Speciﬁcally, we propose to i) upgrade Aikili technology by incorporating a custom-designed disposable cartridge for onsite sample processing and deep learning algorithms for automatic analysis (Aim 1), and ii) evaluate the performance of the upgraded system in LMIC workﬂows through a validation study in Kenya (n = 30) (Aim 2). We will consider the Phase I project successful when we can show that the ﬁeld-optimized Aikili system accurately and reliably detects breast cancer and receptor status in human FNAs compared to accepted gold standards. Successful completion of Phase I would lead to a Phase II application for scale-up of manufacturing and a larger, multi-site clinical validation study. This platform may alter therapeutic paradigms for breast cancer patients in globally and enable appropriate use of chemotherapies and anti-estrogens in limited supply. We will develop a standalone, AI-powered diagnostic system to enable early cancer detection in low resource settings. Our system has the potential to transform cancer diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries where cytopathology is a major bottleneck; it will augment workflows by enabling non-expert healthcare workers to rapidly establish cancer diagnoses and identify molecular subtypes within 1 hour. This will inform the most appropriate therapeutic choices in collaboration with specialist physicians, as well as reduce patient loss to follow-up (LTF) by providing diagnosis in near real-time.",Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries,10154237,R43CA257694,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Cytopathology', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Palpable', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underserved Population', 'University Hospitals', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'operation', 'point of care', 'prospective', 'receptor', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'years of life lost']",NCI,AIKILI BIOSYSTEMS INC.,R43,2021,400000,0
"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI-RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a more precise and clinically relevant predictive model will be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group.

"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Community Practice', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'long short term memory', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811,533302350
"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many lives.",Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone,10115009,R01CA248491,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Country', 'Cytology', 'Cytopathology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunodiagnostics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular pathology', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'data repository', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'subtype-specific therapies', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,607659,607172798
"Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening SUMMARY Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date. Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning “from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable in particular to cancers with more limited datasets. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to detect breast cancer as early as possible while limiting the burden of screening in high-risk women. To this end, risk will be estimated from magnetic resonance images of the breast as well as mammograms using deep learning techniques. A retrospective analysis of a very large dataset will determine if some women could have avoided unnecessary scans without missing newly developing cancers.",Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening,10121555,R01CA247910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancerous', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reader', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'individualized prevention', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'quality assurance', 'radiologist', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,703284,10623740
