"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,10246667,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,10065,164685352,0.06175355042550731
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,10005582,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,188226,178185562,0.02646032920706641

"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9873026,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,206768,593605914,0.03886410244118511
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,685608202,0.03505644416803795
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,558628098,0.044519689117125665
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents Diabetes is a common chronic disease in children and adolescents under age of 18 years. In the recent two decades, both the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. T2D now accounts for ~15% of diabetes cases diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is the only ongoing multisite surveillance study of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The SEARCH study is a population-based registry, which is a more expensive, more labor-intensive, and slower surveillance method compared with a surveillance system using electronic health records (EHRs). EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~3 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse children and adolescents from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US children and adolescents with those in children and adolescents from other countries and regions. This study is innovative because it will leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. All 4 states in this study do not have an active diabetes surveillance system for children and adolescents and are not covered by the SEARCH study. This study will advance our understanding of the geographic, age, sex, and racial/ethnic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The obtained surveillance data will help identify and prioritize subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities to reduce health disparities. The burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. A population-based registry, which is expensive and labor-intensive, has provided estimates for the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents from limited geographic regions in the US. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records covering several other geographic regions, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US children and adolescents according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents,10085447,U18DP006503,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,91477866,0.04119025153408995
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US.

"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9884770,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,388626,77336088,0.029521814402621683
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible.

"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,148186688,-0.032691224776589846
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,24701672,0.0066941235433415625
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden.

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9996775,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,574855,323604360,0.10545783859215584
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,601447,0.014495678548296987
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9967154,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,614537,533594881,-0.003364157142508206
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9969419,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,618136,37921345,0.05503165931125688
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9949789,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662746,533594881,0.07990146616951631
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9936445,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664314,560644462,0.0038523932348707318
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes.

"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9964904,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,698273,61807989,0.08628800220367014
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9903425,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical center', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2020,708937,966815,0.05525598548334927
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9991926,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,728957,533594881,0.0422279763750824
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9947999,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'automated segmentation', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,740371,199779478,0.10137245219438608
"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability and may be targets for future novel preventive efforts.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9881344,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,782692,340417756,-0.0513420362085583
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9883835,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,804498,558628098,-0.0246932391656437
"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,551214295,-0.038504440288607784
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9712985,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'enteric pathogen', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2019,64933,282635,0.06780106251409306
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9773203,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,83750,550947887,0.045605579411345465
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9762199,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'classification trees', 'control trial', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2019,86000,178185562,0.021831431304282382
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9773427,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,199220,164685352,0.06175355042550731
"Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy Broader Impacts  More than 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5, making ear infections among the most common childhood conditions. Family Physicians and Pediatricians see more than 20 million suspected ear infection cases per year in the US. Approximately 40% of these are misdiagnosed infections in healthy ears, leading to 6-9 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions annually. In fact, ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars wasted and millions of children placed at undue risk for adverse side effects. On a societal level, unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant resistant microorganisms adds $20B in excess healthcare costs annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians have identified improved ear infection diagnostics as necessary to slow the spread of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, despite updated clinical guidelines dating back to 1994, no significant reduction in unnecessary prescription rates has been achieved.  Even a modest improvement in ear infection diagnosis has the potential to positively affect millions of children, save hundreds of millions in direct costs, and slow the evolution of resistant bacteria. Cactus invented Optical Tympanometry (OT) technology to improve ear infection diagnosis in primary care, where most cases are seen. Cactus technology is 98% accurate in a clinical study of 30 pediatric participants, and works in clean and waxy ears. Intellectual Merit  Children affected with ear infection are most often too young to adequately describe their symptoms. Signs of ear infections are numerous, but they are also very non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly done by assessing a set of qualitative factors using an otoscope to provide a magnified view of the ear drum. Most clinicians look for middle ear redness. However, redness alone is less than 65% accurate, matching accuracy statistics observed in primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend an objective quantitative assessment of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE). In fact, Key Action Statement 1C in the AAP’s most recent Acute Otitis Media (active ear infection requiring antibiotic treatment, AOM) guideline states:  Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE)  Currently, MEE is often unassessed due to technology limitations. Existing acoustic and pneumatic devices are slow, subjective and can be painful to children. As a result, clinicians commonly prescribe a course of antibiotics out of a preponderance of caution, or to placate parents. Cactus invented OT as a rapid, seamless means of assessing MEE during otoscopy. This SBIR Phase I proposal validates a miniaturized embodiment of OT (LED-OT) built into the familiar otoscope. Specific Aims Aim 1 (Month 0-2): Assembly and Repeatability & Reproducibility Study of LED-OT Otoscopes. Cactus has developed a patent pending (US62/675,056 & US161040195) LED-OT otoscope based on its innovative multiLED microchip, which houses all 13 wavelengths required for OT in a 6x6mm form factor. Cactus will assemble 6 LED-OT otoscope units for rigorous measurement repeatability and reproducibility assessment followed by clinical validation in Aims 2-3. Aim 2 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Collection IRB approved (UCI HS#2016-3039) data collection will take place under the supervision of UC Irvine Professor Elliot Botvinick via a sub-award. Clinical data collection mirrors that used in 510(k) applications for previously cleared acoustic devices and enables receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of LED-OT otoscopy. Aim 3 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Analysis Clinical data analysis will be concurrent with data collection, with two specific goals. First, train OT’s statistical component. Second, validate performance of LED-OT in pediatric participants using ROC analysis. A successful outcome of this proposal will be validated LED-OT technology and 6 otoscopes prepared for a pivotal study in Phase II to compare LED-OT and acoustic methods in an office setting. Together, Phase I and II will prepare LED-OT for analytical and clinical trials necessary for a 510(k) application, encourage adoption of our revolutionary technology, and facilitate private investment and relationships with strategic partners.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,558628098,0.044519689117125665
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9669438,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,262171,593605914,0.03886410244118511
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,9725011,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,297059,533594881,0.02646032920706641
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9750288,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,354625,45341731,0.0005191016729069805
"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9637403,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,388812,77336088,0.029521814402621683
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible.

"Effects of genetic and gestational  risk factors for late onset Alzheimer's disease on neonatal brain morphology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome.

"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9771462,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,556605,37921345,0.05503165931125688
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9728036,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,573724,323604360,0.10545783859215584
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9731643,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,631649,533594881,-0.003364157142508206
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9716320,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,677664,560644462,0.0038523932348707318
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD).

"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9765496,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,711064,593605914,0.004229455925994635
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9731666,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,736672,61807989,0.08628800220367014
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9699521,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,743544,199779478,0.10137245219438608
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9680749,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2019,764643,966815,0.05525598548334927
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9818160,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,784433,533594881,0.0422279763750824
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9662003,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,802904,340417756,-0.0513420362085583
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing.

I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9549157,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2018,62726,282635,0.06780106251409306
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"Early Identification and Service Linkage for Urban Children with Autism: Option 2 Testing Broadband Screening Instruments in Young Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Very early screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - sooner than the current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to screen at a child’s 18 and 24-month well-child visit - could result in earlier diagnosis and more children receiving treatment services at the ages when treatment has demonstrated the greatest impact. This proposal aims to provide new data on the performance characteristics of the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist (IT Checklist), a broadband screening tool for communications delays. Approximately 500 children ages 12-15 months who attend a well child or sick visit at Boston Medical Center’s Pediatric Clinic will be screened with the IT Checklist. All parents will be asked permission to 1) complete the IT Checklist, 2) share the screening results with the child’s primary care provider, and 3) to access the child’s electronic medical record (EMR) to track future developmental screening and assessment. The performance characteristics of the IT Checklist will be assessed via a two-tiered approach: 1) comparing the scores on the IT Checklist with scores on the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) at 12-15 months and 2) comparing the scores on the IT Checklist at 12-15 months to scores on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (MCHAT-R) at 18 and 24 months. For children who are screened with the IT Checklist, scores on the PEDS obtained at the 12 or 15 month well-child visits and scores from the MCHAT-R obtained at the 18 or 24-month well-child visits will be abstracted from the child’s EMR. This will allow researchers to assess concordance of risk identified on the IT Checklist with risk identified by the PEDS and MCHAT-R. We will present descriptive statistics regarding screening results for the entire cohort and stratified by language used to conduct the screen, child age, and parental concerns. We will stratify screening results on the IT Checklist by subscale –language delay (LD), developmental delay (DD), and ASD. We will calculate the kappa statistic for agreement between IT Checklist and PEDS, IT Checklist and MCHAT-R, and IT Checklist and parental concern. The kappa statistic will be obtained for agreement with the IT checklist as a whole and for each of the subscales. Our final step will be to examine the performance of the IT Checklist within this largely low-income ethnically diverse population. We will conduct multivariable logistic regression to assess the relative odds of a failed screen overall and by subscale, taking into account language, child age, and parental concerns.

"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9583736,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,83750,550947887,0.045605579411345465
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9507401,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'base', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2018,86000,178185562,0.021831431304282382
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health.

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9481329,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,123110,208750,0.10137245219438608
"LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms. Project Summary / Abstract ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood, affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings. LemurDx is a concept for a software system for smartwatches and mobile tablets, optimized for clinical use, that uses state-of-the-art, yet relatively low-cost, sensor technology to measure hyperactivity, with the clinical goal of differentiating children with ADHD-hyperactive presentation or ADHD combined presentation from children with typical levels of activity. LemurDx will passively collect data from smartwatch sensors. Clinicians will ask a child to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx application for one day and then collect the de-identified data. The data will be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant secure server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to differentiate children with clinical levels of hyperactivity from those with typical levels of activity, providing clinicians with immediate results. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number of ways. Along with the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors (many of which are not available on actigraphy devices) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the team is carefully designing a complete system based on the unique needs of clinicians. This includes a comprehensive system of secure HIPAA-compliant servers, automated state-of-the- art ML algorithms, pre-programmed mobile tablets and smartwatches for clinical use, a secure and de- identified data architecture, and a simple user interface that eliminates any technological burden on clinicians. Aim 1 of the project is to develop a commercial grade prototype of LemurDx following principles of user- centered design, with feedback from focus groups including children, parents, and clinicians. Aim 2 of the project is to test the feasibility of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from 30 children (ages 6-11) who will wear a smartwatch with LemurDx technology for one day. Aim 3 of the project is to test and refine several ML algorithms to achieve a high level of sensitivity and specificity to accurately classify children with and without ADHD. LemurDx is significant as there is no objective and commercially available measure of hyperactivity to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, despite a great need in settings including pediatric primary-care practices, children’s hospitals, and behavioral health clinics. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure, “that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Innovations include a combination of reliable, inexpensive measurement technology combined with accurate ML algorithms to consistently and objectively measure hyperactivity in a system that is designed for clinical users. We will show that LemurDx has commercialization potential by demonstrating accuracy, cost effectiveness, and user adherence, and will lay the foundation for the development of a scalable clinical delivery system. Project Narrative ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings that can assist in accurate diagnostics. This project will develop a prototype for a software system for smartwatches to measure hyperactivity with objectivity and precision using state-of-the-art sensors and machine learning algorithms.","LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms.",9558075,R41MH119644,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Consumer Satisfaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hour', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'practice setting', 'product development', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'societal costs', 'software systems', 'standardize measure', 'stimulant abuse', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'wearable technology']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R41,2018,221917,0,0.02985129884205372
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,560644462,-0.012386184666312009
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood.

"QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development   Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. RELEVANCE {See instructions): We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism.

"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9455331,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,388993,77336088,0.029521814402621683
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,24701672,0.0066941235433415625
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS This application is being submitted to PA-18-591 in accordance with NOT-OD-18-194. The proposed supplement INCLUDE project is entitled: “Upper Airway Structure and Function and Risk for OSA in Children with Down Syndrome”. The project is within the scope of R01 HL130468 entitled: “A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS” that focuses on implementing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1A) using analytical and machine learning techniques to determine the static (3D) and dynamic (4D) architecture and tissue characteristics of the upper airway in wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1B). These methods are coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Aim 2A) and biomechanical modeling (Aim 2B) to establish the biomechanical basis of OSAS in children with obesity. The parent grant also evaluates the impact of treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on airway mechanics (Aim 3A) and the clinical utility of image-based airway mechanical parameters in OSAS (Aim 3B). The tools and methodologies used in the parent project will be integrated in all Aims of this INCLUDE project. The proposed project addresses 2 important IC-specific priorities of NHLBI: 1) “Incorporation of individuals with Down syndrome into existing disease cohorts and clinical trials directed toward sleep apnea. This could include collection of tissue or blood specimens and -omics data generation and analysis, imaging, and computational modeling”, 2) Identification of potential risk and resilience factors that make individuals with Down syndrome susceptible to transient or persistent blood disorders and congenital heart disease”. The problem: Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of developmental disability and mental retardation with an incidence of 1/800 live births (1). The prevalence of OSA in these children is very high and estimated between 50-95% (2-5), and much higher than the 1-4% prevalence in the general pediatric population (6). OSA has detrimental consequences in children, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive effects (6). This is particularly true for children with Down syndrome who are already predisposed to congenital heart anomalies and developmental delay. Therefore, the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the need to screen for OSA within the first 6 months of life in all children with Down syndrome and continue to evaluate for the disorder on all medical encounters thereafter throughout childhood (7). Anatomical factors related to the Down syndrome phenotype have been attributed to the causation of OSA in this group. These include midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia (8-11), enlarged tongue (12, 13), adenoid and tonsilar hypertrophy (13, 14), laryngo-tracheal anomalies (15), and obesity (16-19). In addition, reduced neuromuscular tone has been suspected of having a role in the development of OSA in these subjects (3). Traditional methods to evaluate the upper airway in children with DS include plain lateral neck radiograph, cephalometric measurements, airway fluoroscopy, and nasal pharyngoscopy (8, 15, 20, 21). However, these methods provide only limited information regarding the entire upper airway structure. During the years our group has developed,applied, and published seminal work on the upper airway structure and function of children using MRI methodology (22-35). This body of work on normal children and children with craniofacial abnormalities including DS created a large MRI database that is the basis for the current proposal. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9772627,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Airway Resistance', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neck', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'shear stress', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,420407,208750,0.0890405483798608
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9596046,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,457033,228951281,0.08917457094152512
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9593233,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,544336,37921345,0.05503165931125688
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,601447,0.014495678548296987
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9553779,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'dysbiosis', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'stool sample', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,619708,533302350,0.07432641736667672
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9568804,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,622284,533594881,-0.003364157142508206
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9503067,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,636092,533594881,0.07990146616951631
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9577420,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,644011,323604360,0.10545783859215584
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9552270,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2018,753980,61807989,0.08628800220367014
"Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The negative consequences of teen parenting are well documented and the associated costs to society exceed $9 billion annually. Children born to teen mothers tend to experience less responsive and supportive parenting and are at heightened risk for a range of social, developmental, and health issues. There is literature to support the positive impact of grandmothers on teen parents and their children. Further, government subsistence programs require that unwed teen parents live with a responsible adult, typically the teen mother's biological mother. But what if the teen's biological mother is also limited in her parenting capacities? How does the impact of limited parenting capacities across these two generations of mothers affect the developing child? This study will examine two important aspects of parenting capacities in teen mothers (TM) and their co- residing mothers (the grandmother; GM) on the young developing child: (1) attachment quality (i.e. parent's ability to form deep, empathic connections to another person) and (2) executive functioning (i.e. parent's ability to organize, plan, multitask, and exhibit self-control). These relational and cognitive capacities are essential components of effective parenting. However, there is little known about their impact on young children's health, wellbeing, and development in the context of being raised by two generations of parents. Using a cross- sectional, descriptive design, a convenience sample of 50 TM/GM dyads co-residing with their 1-3 year old children will be recruited into the study from an urban clinic serving teen parents and children (95% African American). TMs and GMs will independently complete a paper-and-pencil measure of attachment quality and a computerized series of tasks to measure multiple aspects of EF (working memory, inhibitory control, set shifting); a standardized maternal report screening measure will be used to assess the developmental status of the target child. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to examine the relative contributions of attachment quality and EF across two generations of mothers (TM and GM) on young children's developmental risk. The proposed research training plan is foundational to a program of study focused on informing innovative three generation interventions tailored to the needs of teen mothers with the goal of improving health outcomes for families of teen mothers. This area of research is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. The proposed research and accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant to begin a career as an independent nurse scientist in parenting and family research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the applicant is to identify essential components of an effective three-generation intervention that will inform the design and implementation of parenting programs for teen mothers to improve health outcomes, and reduce health and social disparities in their children and families. This study proposes to build on the limited knowledge of essential components of effective parenting in multi-generational families.            ",Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers,9308739,F31NR015961,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Economics', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family Research', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Problem Solving', 'Problem behavior', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Development', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teenagers', 'Training', 'United States', 'Washington', 'career', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'grandchild', 'grandparent', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk parents', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'multitask', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'social', 'social disparities', 'statistics', 'teenage mother', 'teenage parents', 'therapy design']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,40070,807432003,0.07744026343673217
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9402123,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2017,57663,282635,0.06780106251409306

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,415711940,0.044519689117125665
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED. This proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to achieve health equity in the provision of pediatric emergency care.",Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry.,9375043,R03MD011654,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Academy', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Appendicitis', 'Applied Research', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'ethnic difference', 'health care delivery', 'health care disparity', 'health equity', 'inclusion criteria', 'long bone', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial difference', 'response']",NIMHD,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2017,109550,38769994,0.00013391388706691454
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,560644462,-0.012386184666312009
"QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development   Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. RELEVANCE {See instructions): We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism. This project will test and optimize the potential of this tool to provide continuous and naturalized behavioral therapy to children with autism from their homes. n/a",QuBBD: Wearable artificial intelligence for bid data-driven healthcare in child development  ,9394169,R01EB025025,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Running', 'Self-Direction', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Marketing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'applied behavior analysis', 'base', 'care delivery', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'prototype', 'response', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'standard care', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,373870,560644462,0.010557925359901557
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,24701672,0.0066941235433415625
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9469790,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,613948,533594881,-0.003364157142508206
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9349480,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,619708,533302350,0.07432641736667672
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9311704,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,721638,533594881,0.07990146616951631
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9327032,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,757906,208750,0.10137245219438608
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9384268,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2017,782745,61807989,0.08628800220367014
"Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The negative consequences of teen parenting are well documented and the associated costs to society exceed $9 billion annually. Children born to teen mothers tend to experience less responsive and supportive parenting and are at heightened risk for a range of social, developmental, and health issues. There is literature to support the positive impact of grandmothers on teen parents and their children. Further, government subsistence programs require that unwed teen parents live with a responsible adult, typically the teen mother's biological mother. But what if the teen's biological mother is also limited in her parenting capacities? How does the impact of limited parenting capacities across these two generations of mothers affect the developing child? This study will examine two important aspects of parenting capacities in teen mothers (TM) and their co- residing mothers (the grandmother; GM) on the young developing child: (1) attachment quality (i.e. parent's ability to form deep, empathic connections to another person) and (2) executive functioning (i.e. parent's ability to organize, plan, multitask, and exhibit self-control). These relational and cognitive capacities are essential components of effective parenting. However, there is little known about their impact on young children's health, wellbeing, and development in the context of being raised by two generations of parents. Using a cross- sectional, descriptive design, a convenience sample of 50 TM/GM dyads co-residing with their 1-3 year old children will be recruited into the study from an urban clinic serving teen parents and children (95% African American). TMs and GMs will independently complete a paper-and-pencil measure of attachment quality and a computerized series of tasks to measure multiple aspects of EF (working memory, inhibitory control, set shifting); a standardized maternal report screening measure will be used to assess the developmental status of the target child. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to examine the relative contributions of attachment quality and EF across two generations of mothers (TM and GM) on young children's developmental risk. The proposed research training plan is foundational to a program of study focused on informing innovative three generation interventions tailored to the needs of teen mothers with the goal of improving health outcomes for families of teen mothers. This area of research is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. The proposed research and accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant to begin a career as an independent nurse scientist in parenting and family research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the applicant is to identify essential components of an effective three-generation intervention that will inform the design and implementation of parenting programs for teen mothers to improve health outcomes, and reduce health and social disparities in their children and families. This study proposes to build on the limited knowledge of essential components of effective parenting in multi-generational families.            ",Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers,9118770,F31NR015961,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'District of Columbia', 'Economics', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family Research', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Effects', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Problem Solving', 'Problem behavior', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Development', 'Societies', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teenagers', 'Training', 'United States', 'career', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'grandchild', 'grandparent', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk parents', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'multitask', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'social', 'social disparities', 'statistics', 'teenage mother', 'teenage parents', 'therapy design']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,807432003,0.07744026343673217
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8995710,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prevent', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,533594881,0.08118654189834393
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access.

"Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use; (2) To improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating additional sensor technologies; (3) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post-surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a validation study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 and 3 focus on improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, and relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology,9324456,R56HL131574,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'technology/technique', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2016,277123,323604360,0.08772347036144532

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,653525,533302350,0.07432641736667672
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9176080,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Adenoidal structure', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,788036,208750,0.10137245219438608
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,9070770,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'disparity reduction', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2016,796080,929426,0.0050949470173438215
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,9033949,R01MH078829,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'AVPR1A gene', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anger', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'DRD4 gene', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'RGS2 gene', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'anxious behavior', 'base', 'design', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'lens', 'neurodevelopment', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social communication', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,871361,209484975,0.036021462745624906
"Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The negative consequences of teen parenting are well documented and the associated costs to society exceed $9 billion annually. Children born to teen mothers tend to experience less responsive and supportive parenting and are at heightened risk for a range of social, developmental, and health issues. There is literature to support the positive impact of grandmothers on teen parents and their children. Further, government subsistence programs require that unwed teen parents live with a responsible adult, typically the teen mother's biological mother. But what if the teen's biological mother is also limited in her parenting capacities? How does the impact of limited parenting capacities across these two generations of mothers affect the developing child? This study will examine two important aspects of parenting capacities in teen mothers (TM) and their co- residing mothers (the grandmother; GM) on the young developing child: (1) attachment quality (i.e. parent's ability to form deep, empathic connections to another person) and (2) executive functioning (i.e. parent's ability to organize, plan, multitask, and exhibit self-control). These relational and cognitive capacities are essential components of effective parenting. However, there is little known about their impact on young children's health, wellbeing, and development in the context of being raised by two generations of parents. Using a cross- sectional, descriptive design, a convenience sample of 50 TM/GM dyads co-residing with their 1-3 year old children will be recruited into the study from an urban clinic serving teen parents and children (95% African American). TMs and GMs will independently complete a paper-and-pencil measure of attachment quality and a computerized series of tasks to measure multiple aspects of EF (working memory, inhibitory control, set shifting); a standardized maternal report screening measure will be used to assess the developmental status of the target child. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to examine the relative contributions of attachment quality and EF across two generations of mothers (TM and GM) on young children's developmental risk. The proposed research training plan is foundational to a program of study focused on informing innovative three generation interventions tailored to the needs of teen mothers with the goal of improving health outcomes for families of teen mothers. This area of research is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. The proposed research and accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant to begin a career as an independent nurse scientist in parenting and family research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the applicant is to identify essential components of an effective three-generation intervention that will inform the design and implementation of parenting programs for teen mothers to improve health outcomes, and reduce health and social disparities in their children and families. This study proposes to build on the limited knowledge of essential components of effective parenting in multi-generational families.            ",Intergenerational Attachment and Executive Functioning and the Development of Young Children of Adolescent Mothers,8985736,F31NR015961,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'District of Columbia', 'Economics', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family Research', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Effects', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Problem Solving', 'Problem behavior', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Development', 'Societies', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teenagers', 'Training', 'United States', 'career', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'grandchild', 'grandparent', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk parents', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'multitask', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'social', 'social disparities', 'statistics', 'teenage mother', 'teenage parents', 'therapy design']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,807432003,0.07744026343673217
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,8874869,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2015,155744,37921345,0.021367386201848373
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.                ",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8870047,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,228750,533594881,0.08118654189834393
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8829343,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2015,348000,551214295,0.005379851774021398
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,8926935,U01DE024167,"['11 year old', '9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'African American', 'Appointment', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fluoride Varnishes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laws', 'Letters', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Ohio', 'Oral health', 'Oregon', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Dentition', 'Private Practice', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tooth structure', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'burden of illness', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'demographics', 'design', 'elementary school', 'follow-up', 'fourth grade', 'health disparity', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'kindergarten', 'meetings', 'permanent tooth', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'restoration', 'screening', 'second grade', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'three-arm study', 'trend', 'urgent care']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,641750,197030888,0.07611718859413232
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8929222,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,645802,533302350,0.07432641736667672
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,8816129,R01MH078829,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'AVPR1A gene', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anger', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'DRD4 gene', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'RGS2 gene', 'Relative (related person)', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'anxious behavior', 'base', 'design', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'lens', 'neurodevelopment', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social communication', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,764840,209484975,0.036021462745624906
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8894598,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2015,796060,929426,0.0050949470173438215
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.         PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.

"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,209484975,0.06500349058531038
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.            ",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8815576,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,675943,533302350,0.07432641736667672
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.            ",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8714587,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2014,796039,929426,0.0050949470173438215
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.                ",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,8670962,U01DE024167,"['11 year old', '9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'African American', 'Appointment', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fluoride Varnishes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laws', 'Letters', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Ohio', 'Oral health', 'Oregon', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Primary Dentition', 'Private Practice', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tooth structure', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'antibiotic K 4', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'burden of illness', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'demographics', 'design', 'elementary school', 'follow-up', 'fourth grade', 'health disparity', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'kindergarten', 'meetings', 'permanent tooth', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'restoration', 'screening', 'second grade', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'three-arm study', 'trend', 'urgent care']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,801073,197030888,0.07611718859413232
"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to  use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all. This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health. This project aims to develop a new tool for deciding how to personalize (that is, individualize or  customize) treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This has important  clinical and public-health relevance because, although research has established efficacious treatments  for many child and adolescent mental health disorders, little is known about which children are more or  less likely to benefit from one treatment or another.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8494094,R03MH097954,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Seminal', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Sterile coverings', 'Symptoms', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2013,79358,641965656,0.04639500558153623
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.          PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8483291,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2013,343560,551214295,0.005379851774021398
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all.  This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health.                  PROJEC NARRAIVE: Thspojectaimstodevelopanew too fo decdnghow topesonlze(thatis,indvdulzeo  cusomiz)tramn forchildrnandadolscns ihmnalhalhdisoThrdsrhs.simpotnt cinclandpu-hbeialcthrelevancebecause, althoughrserchhsestbished efccioustretments o mny chldandadolescent mentlhelthdsoders,ltteisknown bout whichchldenaemoeo lsslikly obnfitfrom on ramn oranohr.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8359143,R03MH097954,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Seminal', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Sterile coverings', 'Symptoms', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2012,87008,641965656,0.04075991982912145
"Analysis of Longitudinal Cardiopulmonary Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been accepted by the pediatric community that blood pressure levels in children are meaningful and have consistently shown correlation with adult bp levels in many studies. In addition, obesity levels in children have increased resulting in corresponding increases in pediatric bp levels. The standard protocol for screening high blood pressure in children is to measure bp on 3 separate visits; if bp is above the 95th percentile on each visit, then a child is designated as hypertensive. In specific aim 1 of this application, we consider alternative possibly more efficient adaptive screening rules that will be useful in identifying hypertensive children in clinical trials and managing them in clinical practice. In specific aims 2 and 3 of this application, we propose to refine the relationship between adult and pediatric bp levels using data from the Bogalusa Heart study and the Fels study which have long-term follow-up data of pediatric cohorts into young and mid-adulthood. Childhood bp levels will be characterized both over the long-term based on average levels throughout childhood and adolescence as well as over the short-term based on 3 repeated visits 6 months apart to approximately mimic serial bp readings obtained in clinical practice. Logistic regression models (aim 2) and autoregressive linear mixed models with measurement error (aim 3) will be used for this purpose. Finally, in aim 4, SAS and SPSS macros will be developed to enable researchers to obtain bp percentiles and z-scores adjusted for age, sex and height in batch mode. This will supplement the currently available SAS macro which computes bp percentiles and z- scores on an individual level which is useful in clinical practice.

"Dx Ear: An automated tool for diagnosis of otitis media    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Otitis media is a general term for middle-ear inflammation that is classified clinically as either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM represents a bacterial super infection of the middle ear fluid and OME a sterile effusion that tends to subside spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally beneficial only for AOM. Accurate diagnosis of AOM, as well as distinction from both OME and no effusion (NOE) requires considerable training.  AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed for children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media.1 AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media.2 Given these considerations, our goal is to:  Develop a software tool to classify images into one of three stringent clinical diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE), and validate the algorithm on tympanic membrane (TM) images.  We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team that can successfully develop an automated diagnostic algorithm in this Phase-I program. We have (1) gathered a team of nationally-recognized otoscopists with substantial clinical and research experience in the context of AOM clinical trials; (2) studied the predictive value of diagnostic findings in discriminating AOM from OME from NOE; (3) acquired a large number of TM images from children; and (4) involved an internationally recognized expert in developing algorithms in all areas of image analysis and processing.  In the planned Phase-II, we will use the algorithm developed in the Phase-I program and incorporate it into a user-friendly and marketable digital otoscope-software platform that can be used at the point-of-care by clinicians to improve the care of children with this frequently occurring condition. This will be followed by a clinical trial evaluating its immediate impact on clinical care, and, in particular, utilization of antimicrobials.  Our main goal will be to develop an accurate automated algorithm for classifying the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We aim to achieve an overall accuracy of 95 percent by applying a newly developed classification algorithm. This will include applying state-of-the-art classification methods as well as segmentation algorithms, for automated, robust diagnosis and classification of the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We propose to achieve this through the following two specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a robust and accurate diagnostic algorithm that can discriminate TM digital images into 1of 3 stringent diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE).  Specific Aim 2: Validate the algorithm on a dataset that includes over 2000 TM images collected in a recently completed NIAID-sponsored clinical trial.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"MARKERS AND MODIFICATION OF EARLY READING FAILURE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this investigation is to improve the precision of early identification screening for reading failure and to determine the extent to which secondary prevention modifies its probability. The emotional and economic sequelae of reading failure in a highly literate society represent a public health concern. Despite the unprecedented national attention given to the problem of reading failure, a model that accurately identifies who will and who will not exhibit early reading failure does not exist. The number of potential marker variables are legion but have yet to be coordinated into a cohesive system that is theoretically robust and systematically tested. In addition, the duration of research-based reading intervention and its long term effects on at-risk children are rarely studied. Two research questions are designed to address the limitations of past research: (a) Is the precision of early identification screening improved by incorporating fluency and growth measures; and (b) Does the probability of reading failure defined by the early identification screen interact with instructional duration to modify the risk of reading failure both immediately and longitudinally? A novel aspect of the design is defining risk of reading failure continuously as probability level rather than dichotomously. The research plan incorporates a multiple cohort design in which three successive cohorts of first grade children are selected (N=250-300 across years). In Year 1, measures tested for the early identification screen include accuracy and fluency measures collected as point estimates (static measurement) and across time (growth measurement). We hypothesize that the lack of attention to fluency and growth has hampered past early identification efforts.

"Analysis of Longitudinal Cardiopulmonary Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been accepted by the pediatric community that blood pressure levels in children are meaningful and have consistently shown correlation with adult bp levels in many studies. In addition, obesity levels in children have increased resulting in corresponding increases in pediatric bp levels. The standard protocol for screening high blood pressure in children is to measure bp on 3 separate visits; if bp is above the 95th percentile on each visit, then a child is designated as hypertensive. In specific aim 1 of this application, we consider alternative possibly more efficient adaptive screening rules that will be useful in identifying hypertensive children in clinical trials and managing them in clinical practice. In specific aims 2 and 3 of this application, we propose to refine the relationship between adult and pediatric bp levels using data from the Bogalusa Heart study and the Fels study which have long-term follow-up data of pediatric cohorts into young and mid-adulthood. Childhood bp levels will be characterized both over the long-term based on average levels throughout childhood and adolescence as well as over the short-term based on 3 repeated visits 6 months apart to approximately mimic serial bp readings obtained in clinical practice. Logistic regression models (aim 2) and autoregressive linear mixed models with measurement error (aim 3) will be used for this purpose. Finally, in aim 4, SAS and SPSS macros will be developed to enable researchers to obtain bp percentiles and z-scores adjusted for age, sex and height in batch mode. This will supplement the currently available SAS macro which computes bp percentiles and z- scores on an individual level which is useful in clinical practice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Analysis of longitudinal cardiopulmonary data Relevance: An important goal of this application is to identify better methods for screening children for hypertension and evaluating treatment efficacy among hypertensive children. A second important goal is to estimate the effect of elevated childhood blood pressure on subsequent adult levels of bp. A third important goal is to propose better method of analysis for longitudinal bp based on the Fels data which includes data on 826 children seen at e 10 visits from early childhood to age 65. These methods should be applicable to other long-term longitudinal bp datasets as well as longitudinal analyses of pulmonary function data and other cardiopulmonary measures.           Analysis of longitudinal cardiopulmonary data Relevance: An important goal of this application is to identify better methods for screening children for hypertension and evaluating treatment efficacy among hypertensive children.

"Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program-DOVE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children witnessing the intimate partner violence (IPV) of their mothers are known to have sedous long-term physical and mental health and behavioral consequences. While almost half of these children were less than 6 years old, little is known about appropriate interventions for very young children and their abused mothers. Building on the demonstrated positive effects of early home visitation models of providing care, this study proposes to incorporate routine screening for IPV and a structured IPV intervention into existing home visitation (HV) programs for young families expecting a child. Traditional home visitation and Olds model of home visitation programs will be examined using a two-group quasi experimental design with nurses randomized to provide a structured IPV intervention to pregnant/postpartum women or to provide standard care or usual care to women who disclose IPV.

"MARKERS AND MODIFICATION OF EARLY READING FAILURE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this investigation is to improve the precision of early identification screening for reading failure and to determine the extent to which secondary prevention modifies its probability. The emotional and economic sequelae of reading failure in a highly literate society represent a public health concern. Despite the unprecedented national attention given to the problem of reading failure, a model that accurately identifies who will and who will not exhibit early reading failure does not exist. The number of potential marker variables are legion but have yet to be coordinated into a cohesive system that is theoretically robust and systematically tested. In addition, the duration of research-based reading intervention and its long term effects on at-risk children are rarely studied. Two research questions are designed to address the limitations of past research: (a) Is the precision of early identification screening improved by incorporating fluency and growth measures; and (b) Does the probability of reading failure defined by the early identification screen interact with instructional duration to modify the risk of reading failure both immediately and longitudinally? A novel aspect of the design is defining risk of reading failure continuously as probability level rather than dichotomously. The research plan incorporates a multiple cohort design in which three successive cohorts of first grade children are selected (N=250-300 across years). In Year 1, measures tested for the early identification screen include accuracy and fluency measures collected as point estimates (static measurement) and across time (growth measurement). We hypothesize that the lack of attention to fluency and growth has hampered past early identification efforts. Multiple regression and dominance analysis are used to assess impact on reading measured continuously and to reduce the variable set. Logistic regression is used to develop the best fitting algorithm to predict reading failure and produce probabilities. This algorithm is applied in Years 2 and 3 to identify children with higher probabilities of failure (N=180). These children are assigned to a no treatment control or to intervention that lasts 10 weeks or 16 weeks. Duration is varied to understand what is gained and lost by the intervention lengths typically used in reading intervention research. All three cohorts are followed through third grade with the diagnostic battery.         n/a",MARKERS AND MODIFICATION OF EARLY READING FAILURE,7029513,R01HD046758,"['behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'child psychology', 'clinical research', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'data quality /integrity', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'learning', 'learning transfer', 'longitudinal human study', 'mathematical model', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'middle childhood (6-11)', 'model design /development', 'reading', 'reading disorder']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND COLLEGE PK CAMPUS,R01,2006,478066,0,0.057620660415187555
"Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program-DOVE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children witnessing the intimate partner violence (IPV) of their mothers are known to have sedous long-term physical and mental health and behavioral consequences. While almost half of these children were less than 6 years old, little is known about appropriate interventions for very young children and their abused mothers. Building on the demonstrated positive effects of early home visitation models of providing care, this study proposes to incorporate routine screening for IPV and a structured IPV intervention into existing home visitation (HV) programs for young families expecting a child. Traditional home visitation and Olds model of home visitation programs will be examined using a two-group quasi experimental design with nurses randomized to provide a structured IPV intervention to pregnant/postpartum women or to provide standard care or usual care to women who disclose IPV. Home visitors (nurses and trained lay visitors) in each home visitation program will be randomized to the intervention or a comparison condition. There will be four groups of 60 families from an urban (2 groups) and rural (2 groups) home visitation settings. Mothers and infants plus one child less than 6 years (if there is one) in all families will be monitored at birth, 3 months, 6 months and then at 6-month intervals through 24 months.
