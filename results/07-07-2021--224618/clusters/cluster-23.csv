"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,77607041,0.002597582805401527
"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,679991,0.0012634143930269131
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,740405,-0.01030565870533599
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,54868437,0.0007139738885448358
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10074037,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,18249,338121506,0.015324466139281647
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,9992699,F31MH123131,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Fura-2', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferon Activation', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Ions', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'PF4 Gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'adenosine deaminase', 'biomarker discovery', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data visualization', 'detector', 'differential expression', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'dopaminergic differentiation', 'excitotoxicity', 'experience', 'immune activation', 'in silico', 'innate immune pathways', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood regulation', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel marker', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'serotonin receptor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual machine']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29830,5062280,-0.08312324770048828
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,83544663,0.02130812975168886
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,241268189,-0.004751736278238638
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,9813516,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37351,607172798,-0.0031501172047590114
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9989900,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and inform future clinical research.",The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence,10066511,F31HD103340,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'data collection site', 'developmental psychology', 'disability', 'early adolescence', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait', 'tv watching']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,F31,2020,44712,89437,0.0022534572356531658
"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,9990180,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,550947887,0.011906336012314262
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9963415,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,11430998,0.023769572059745055
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9962148,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2020,69926,5627670,0.004757501612180246
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,55098220,0.013974435850171864
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,533302350,0.012878227477245829
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10054751,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'structured data', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162963,533594881,0.018482346359727238
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10169552,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,174599,178569161,0.009492929120276342
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,673201228,-0.042542928316408976
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,533594881,0.005809983289188617
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9974565,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,186155,551214295,0.006871074141935635
"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD",10054894,K23MH121650,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional disorder', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'atomoxetine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'sustained attention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational clinical trial', 'treatment response']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,560644462,-0.012501420668553058
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9985197,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic stress']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2020,193644,178185562,-0.03703476710152725
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9973236,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,194584,135644722,0.005304400905023172
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual. The goal of this K23 proposal is to characterize the digital phenotype of bipolar disorder in adolescents in order to prospectively predict mood symptoms, creating an opportunity to reduce the harmful effects of recurrent episodes.",The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms,9996797,K23MH120505,"['Accelerometer', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Android', 'Award', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diurnal Rhythm', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'common symptom', 'computer science', 'cost', 'digital', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'service utilization', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2020,195480,30160331,0.015270093503652831
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,81181560,0.014913750586532822
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9995592,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'social structure', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,211875,415711940,0.005014043499608623
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,237101,168440418,-0.030653237979761657
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,550947887,0.021703476772187483
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion.

"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis.

"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10156737,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2020,249000,90710179,-0.00842474522320496
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,148186688,0.0031057017966120573
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9949794,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,385524,50343425,0.009190624094806447
"Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19 Project Summary/Abstract States and localities nationwide are taking unprecedented steps to reduce public health threats posed by COVID-19, including school closures affecting >50 million youth. The pandemic has also caused families extreme financial hardship, sudden unemployment, and distress. This combination of collective trauma, social isolation, and economic recession drastically increases risk for adolescent major depression (MD): already the lead cause of disability in youth. However, youth MD treatments face problems of potency and accessibility. Up to 65% of youth receiving MD treatment fail to respond, partly due to MD’s heterogeneity: an MD diagnosis reflects >1400 possible symptom combinations, highlighting the need for treatments matched to personal need. Treatment accessibility issues are similarly severe. Before the pandemic, <50% of youth with MD accessed any treatment at all; newfound financial strain will further preclude families’ capacity to afford care for their children. It is thus critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to buffer against youth MD in the context of COVID-19, along with strategies to match such interventions with youth most likely to benefit. This project will integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale SSI research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing adolescent MD during COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1,200 youth with elevated MD symptoms, ages 12-16), Aim 1 is to test whether (1) evidence-based SSIs improve proximal targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which has predicted longer-term SSI response) and 3- month clinical outcomes (MD severity) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral MD symptoms are most impactful in this context. In a fully-online trial, youths recruited from across the U.S. will be randomized to 1 of 3 self-administered SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, targeting behavioral MD symptoms (anhedonia; activity withdrawal); an SSI teaching growth mindset, the belief that personal traits are malleable, targeting cognitive MD symptoms (e.g. hopelessness); or a control SSI. Per baseline, post-SSI, and 3-month follow-up data, we will test each SSI’s relative benefits, versus the control, in the context of COVID-19. Results will reveal whether SSIs targeting behavioral versus cognitive symptoms differentially reduce overall MD severity in this context. Aim 2 is to test whether (and, if so, which of) SSIs can impact COVID-19 specific trauma and anxiety symptoms, informing whether novel, COVID-19-tailored supports may be needed to reduce pandemic-specific mental health sequelae. Aim 3 is to test person-level and contextual predictors of SSI response, via machine-learning techniques, regardless of overall intervention effects observed. Given MD’s heterogeneity, we will test whether baseline symptoms (e.g., having more severe cognitive or behavioral MD symptoms) predict response to SSIs targeting different symptom types. We will also test exposure to COVID-19-related adversities (e.g. parent job loss; loved one hospitalized for COVID-19) and general disadvantage (e.g. family low-income; racial minority status) forecast SSI response. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale single-session intervention (SSI) research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing depression in adolescents in the context of COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1200 adolescents), goals are to test whether evidence- based SSIs improve proximal targets (hopelessness, perceived agency, anhedonia) and clinical outcomes 3 months later (depression symptoms and COVID-19-related anxiety and trauma) in adolescents experiencing depression; whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral depression symptoms produce more favorable outcomes, versus an active control; and whether individual profiles of symptoms or COVID-19-related adversity exposure predicts individual-level SSI response. Results may identify novel, immediately actionable strategies to matching adolescents to targeted SSIs based on personal needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19",10164526,DP5OD028123,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Dropout', 'Economic Recession', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Administration', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Unemployment', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Youth', 'active control', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'loved ones', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'response', 'social media', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'trauma symptom', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",OD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,DP5,2020,392813,77607041,0.035924431489475356
"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9983971,R01MH120092,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,401699,80786674,0.029112075829727534
"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,31777928,-0.007081890741080347
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9984270,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,411201,168440418,-0.006873342986968149
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,551214295,0.011108019633287744
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients,10157747,R41MH122201,"['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Medication', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Financial cost', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'New Mexico', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Ontario', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatrist', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adulthood', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'web portal']",NIMH,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GROUP,R41,2020,437555,437555,0.00709519661329004
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,9851154,-0.007507017692217571
"Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The most widely used empirically supported treatment for EDs (cognitive behavior therapy) is only efficacious for ~50% of individuals. This low response rate is due to the fact that EDs are heterogeneous conditions with diverse symptom trajectories that are not adequately addressed in current “one-size-fits-all” psychotherapies. Until we can identify what maintains or exacerbates individual symptoms, clinicians will continue to have difficulty accurately predicting prognosis and will have no empirical guidance to develop targeted treatment plans to promote recovery. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of network theory will enable the identification of cognitive-behavioral symptom networks that maintain and ‘trigger’ EDs both between and within individuals. Our study goals are to (1) identify individual ED ‘trigger’ symptoms (cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiology) and (2) correlate trigger symptoms with real-time physiological data to create an algorithm predicting onset of ED behaviors. These goals will ultimately identify symptoms that prevent full remission and lead to relapse. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach combined with novel, cutting-edge advances in network science. We will collect intensive real- time data on cognitions, behavior, affect, and physiology using mobile and sensor-technology from 120 individuals with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, and bulimia nervosa across 30 days. At 1-month and 6-month follow ups we will assess ED outcomes (e.g., remission status, ED behaviors) to test if ‘trigger’ symptoms predict ED outcomes. Network science and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will allow us, for the first time, to discover whether certain trigger symptoms predict worse outcomes. Specific aims are to (1) develop personalized networks to identify which cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiological symptoms maintain EDs and predict ED outcomes and (2) utilize sensor data to identify physiological patterns both within and across people that correlate with core maintaining symptoms and that predict ED behaviors. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data collection methods, all remote procedures, novel advances in network science and sensor-technology, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which personalized symptoms trigger EDs. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that contribute to symptom network variation within individuals, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will identify the maintaining symptoms of eating disorders within individuals. The proposed research has significant public health relevance, as it will lead to personalized, novel, effective treatments that promote full remission and decrease the high societal burden associated with eating disorders. The proposed research is relevant to NIH’s precision medicine initiative, as it will identify within-person, maintenance symptoms of eating disorders, leading to personalized treatments delivered via mobile or sensor technology.",Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes,10044077,R15MH121445,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binge Eating', 'Bulimia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epilepsy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'food restriction', 'innovation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'standard care', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment planning', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2020,463165,73765201,0.022053286410649627
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,36067938,-0.029621373186647
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9850564,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,466715,83544663,-0.025839736543592427
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9952129,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,501996,340417756,0.021729377145159667
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Buprenorphine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naltrexone', 'Observational Study', 'Overdose', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Suicide attempt', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'World Health', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chronic pain', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'health record', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'member', 'mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction model', 'severe mental illness', 'social factors', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,111231681,-0.0795168200340935
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,41751724,-0.01325972269528829
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,551214295,0.01974320406135587
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9828783,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,555799,227555357,0.015559915776081042
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,44711126,0.01768994074903429
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,550947887,0.02608298719729149
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9984552,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2020,579461,65771974,-0.0022323630545071447
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms.

We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9985102,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,603973,227555357,0.02435180827289268
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9914128,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,640014,45341731,0.014634965917401788
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,164685352,0.003701072290487867
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,7903567,0.0005600915679868183
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9812223,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,687420,570146095,0.043264413096767894
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9986599,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,692873,34544143,-0.06023769015407345
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,43632870,0.010335222608484925
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,44711126,0.031994034980690034
"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9873081,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,734680,593605914,0.014171876514666577
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9850289,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,735296,338121506,0.015324466139281647
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments.

"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms. Identifying such markers for bipolar disorder has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of illness and informing treatment planning and personalized interventions.",From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models,9860596,R01MH121451,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'high-risk adolescents', 'hypomania', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'mobile application', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,741587,570146095,0.00871249475793114
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,44711126,0.006795915540841042
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9952335,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,756872,178569161,0.009492929120276342
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,9965404,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,760581,44711126,0.028822231610463662
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,593605914,0.015677802323666015
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9988322,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,832266,327644200,-0.01925726305845187
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,68331629,0.0023548752481689474
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,9985547,R01MH121411,"['Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'causal model', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'longitudinal course', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'white matter']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,839437,415711940,0.003872032131911966
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9996319,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical trial participant', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2020,1202772,329565273,-0.0063567681767173635
"Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols Project summary: The main objectives of this project are to perform longitudinal collection of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from a cohort of adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls; and to develop a set of analytical tools that can be used to study the developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in this population. The project builds on the ongoing collaboration of our team in a Connectomes Related to Human Disease U01 project, the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA) study, where we have been performing extensive clinical characterization and MRI scanning with Human Connectome Project (HCP) protocols on adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. These baseline data (current total: N=170; final target: N=225) are set to become available publicly through the HCP database. Here we propose to collect longitudinal data on this unique, thoroughly characterized cohort. Following up on these subjects will allow us to investigate the complex relationship between longitudinal changes in neural circuitry and the onset, persistence, or recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders. We will tackle this by bringing together an investigative team with strong expertise in adolescent mood disorders and in neuroimaging data analysis. The MPIs have extensive experience in developing publicly available software tools for the analysis of brain connections from diffusion MRI (Yendiki) and functional MRI (Whitfield-Gabrieli). In this project, we propose to develop robust, automated tools for segmenting deep-brain structures and white-matter pathways that are of interest in psychiatric disorders. This development will build on our prior work in unbiased methods for longitudinal morphometric and tractography analyses. We will leverage the proposed longitudinal dataset and tools for accurate delineation of individual anatomy to perform a number of novel analyses that will go beyond conventional group-wise comparisons. Specifically, we will focus on analyses that allow us to predict clinical outcomes in individual subjects based on their neural circuitry. We will use machine-learning techniques to map the normative developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in healthy adolescents, including our controls and those from the development HCP. We will then investigate how and when the trajectories of individual adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders deviate from this normative trajectory. The longitudinal data set that we will collect and the software tools that we will develop will be shared with the research community. Our analysis methods will be applicable beyond this cohort, and could be used to study disease mechanisms and predict outcomes in a wide range of brain-related disorders across the human lifespan. Project narrative: This project will follow up on a cohort of adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls to collect clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data over time. Depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed during adolescence predict negative long-term consequences in adulthood. Clarifying the neural circuitry that contributes to the onset, persistence, and recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders is a key step towards developing novel biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, as well as novel treatment targets for more effective therapeutics.",Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols,10057408,R56MH121426,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Interview', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'age group', 'analytical tool', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'child depression', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'connectome', 'data quality', 'disease mechanisms study', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'human data', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2020,1225770,551214295,-0.0011718358358413176
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9979970,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,1261241,570146095,0.011887241320307206
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.

"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,77607041,0.002597582805401527
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,113554200,0.003997938805534139
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9697399,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,10000,524978793,0.02692335168698315
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,241268189,-0.004751736278238638
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,54868437,0.0007139738885448358
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,11430998,0.023769572059745055
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the

excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial

including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9765040,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9832833,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2019,65854,5627670,0.004757501612180246
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86953,44711126,0.031994034980690034
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,65771974,0.019036043040758226
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9952669,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,119406,524978793,0.02692335168698315
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9674530,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,128483,673201228,0.013859801453228451
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,55098220,0.013974435850171864
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,533302350,0.012878227477245829
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9938893,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2019,169483,329565273,-0.0063567681767173635
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9743874,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'decision making algorithm', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,176167,304670088,0.016203526154590798
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,533594881,0.005809983289188617
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9723205,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,186155,551214295,0.006871074141935635
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9822873,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2019,192500,135644722,0.005304400905023172
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9806213,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2019,193644,178185562,-0.03703476710152725
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,168440418,-0.001611634855550232
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options. This research proposes novel analytic methods to discover new powerful, yet interpretable personalized treatment strategies and integrate evidence of strategies identified in multiple prior studies to increase robustness and reproducibility.",Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies.,9774303,R21MH117458,"['Age', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bulimia', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Psychiatry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mental health center', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,558628098,0.016795641370321305
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,550947887,0.021703476772187483
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, this proposal develops an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world.",GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN,9999721,R00EY028229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Neuromechanics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'area MST', 'area MT', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromechanism', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treadmill', 'treatment planning', 'visual control', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-motor integration']",NEI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,38247784,-0.004128132645402066
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9827207,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2019,254250,415711940,0.005014043499608623
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,81181560,0.014913750586532822
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge from the transcranial magnetic and electrical DC stimulation experiments may have translational applications for rehabilitation following brain injuries.",Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms,9718188,R01DC014736,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Music', 'Neurobiology', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'alpha-SNAP', 'attentional bias', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive process', 'cost shifting', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'image guided', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'prefrontal lobe', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2019,263449,14847250,0.022654263171228067
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,148186688,0.0031057017966120573
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9688607,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,385524,50343425,0.009190624094806447
"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,574179,-0.0010620074981529727
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9830832,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image Analysis', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2019,418757,168440418,-0.006873342986968149
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9614566,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,438611,83544663,-0.025839736543592427
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,641965656,0.027107176163397313
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9760006,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,501996,340417756,0.021729377145159667
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,593605914,0.00437781141610876
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,551214295,0.01974320406135587
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9801140,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,554286,34544143,-0.06023769015407345
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9606512,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,570175,227555357,0.015559915776081042
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9739115,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2019,579461,65771974,-0.0022323630545071447
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,44711126,0.01768994074903429
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,507546965,0.004516140818969138
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,227555357,0.02435180827289268
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9736791,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,661398,91740242,0.0234510583111764
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,7903567,0.0005600915679868183
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9739933,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,682250,45341731,0.014634965917401788
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9614335,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,684196,570146095,0.043264413096767894
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,32639530,-5.47874411142094e-05
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,178569161,0.009492929120276342
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,338121506,0.015324466139281647
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9682508,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,736103,593605914,0.014171876514666577
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9755521,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,740241,44711126,0.031994034980690034
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,593605914,0.027817273548005436
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9737676,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,804907,593605914,0.006768291645049869
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,43632870,0.010335222608484925
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,68331629,0.0023548752481689474
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9817776,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,891796,327644200,-0.01925726305845187
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9786648,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2019,1202772,329565273,-0.0063567681767173635
"Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes” defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care. Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, due partly to the fact that existing antidepressants are not effective for all patients and it is often challenging to match individual patients to the treatments that are most likely to help them. This project will test a new strategy for using fMRI brain scans to predict antidepressant response and assist clinicians in choosing which of two antidepressant treatments— transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting one of two depression-related brain areas—is most likely to benefit an individual patient.",Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression,9648914,R01MH118388,"['Accounting', 'Aftercare', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'anxious', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical predictors', 'comparative efficacy', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy trial', 'electric field', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tractography', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,1245371,227555357,0.0067853916674921804
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9697234,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,1273593,570146095,0.011887241320307206
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,740405,-0.0019624153738954414
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high-risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually-based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9693574,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2018,8467,524978793,0.027022565080554967
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9615336,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,21194,77607041,0.002597582805401527
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'stimulant use', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,10556652,0.00907235753439157
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9507688,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2018,28735,61050884,0.021836059141404428
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,54868437,0.0007139738885448358
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9534942,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,36594,11430998,0.023769572059745055
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,593605914,0.010678771429757915

"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9608179,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,113554200,0.003997938805534139
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,65771974,0.019036043040758226
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Abstract Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion.

"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9505794,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2018,128072,673201228,0.013859801453228451
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9526512,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2018,129737,55098220,0.013974435850171864
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,68331629,0.03274164015776923

These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Abstract Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents.

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD. The proposed research will provide new insights into the childhood ADHD and eventually aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatments for this disorder.",Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD,9504511,K01MH105625,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'experience', 'inattention', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,168313,560644462,-0.007966659838067913
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9530687,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2018,186155,551214295,0.006871074141935635
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,304670088,-0.012250163056560782
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9529387,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192351,304670088,0.016203526154590798
"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,168440418,-0.001611634855550232
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options. This research proposes novel analytic methods to discover new powerful, yet interpretable personalized treatment strategies and integrate evidence of strategies identiﬁed in multiple prior studies to increase robustness and reproducibility.",Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies.,9581848,R21MH117458,"['Age', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bulimia', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Psychiatry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mental health center', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2018,202500,558628098,0.016513576158600867
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,68331629,-0.0007757641079634115
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge from the transcranial magnetic and electrical DC stimulation experiments may have translational applications for rehabilitation following brain injuries.",Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms,9513308,R01DC014736,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Music', 'Neurobiology', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'alpha-SNAP', 'attentional bias', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive process', 'cost shifting', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'image guided', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'prefrontal lobe', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2018,262412,14847250,0.022654263171228067
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,58504236,0.005667476143132845
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9520444,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347813,607172798,0.0012178060392502624
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9471432,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,385524,50343425,0.009190624094806447
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Abstract Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9502368,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'anti social', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wearable device']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,414455,524978793,0.00976185175904528
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,68331629,-0.012056673196320623
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,641965656,0.027107176163397313
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,340417756,0.021729377145159667
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,593605914,0.00437781141610876
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9470490,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,554686,227555357,0.015559915776081042
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,551214295,0.0018043367369938695
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,68331629,0.0023548752481689474
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,7903567,0.0005600915679868183
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,32639530,-5.47874411142094e-05
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,91740242,0.0234510583111764
"Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety Project Summary / Abstract Biomarkers have transformed the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions. In contrast, psychiatric biomarkers remain largely elusive, due in part to the fact that there is a weak correspondence between psychiatric diagnoses and their neurobiological substrates. This is especially true for depression and anxiety disorders, clinically heterogeneous conditions associated with abnormal reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli—and to the cues that predict them—and varied patterns of dysfunction in neural circuits that process positive and negative valence. This project will investigate how arousal processes interact with VS circuits to influence the anticipation and experience of rewarding and aversive stimuli in patients seeking treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety, independent of conventional diagnostic categories. It is specifically designed to advance the goals of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project, by focusing on four related RDoC constructs that are directly germane to this question—arousal, potential threat threat, approach motivation, and reward attainment—and testing whether they explain variation in symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia in clinical populations. Importantly, this project will also advance RDoC's goal of developing new ways of classifying mental disorders, which will ultimately require methods for identifying novel diagnostic classes linked to homogeneous pathophysiology. To this end, we will test a strategy for discovering novel diagnostic subtypes defined by clustered patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in valence system circuits. We will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to develop classifiers for diagnosing these subtypes in individual patients, and we will seek to identify distinct mechanisms by which atypical valence system reactivity may contribute to anxiety, anhedonia, and abnormal approach motivation and avoidance behavior in distinct patient subgroups, indexed in the laboratory via integrated, convergent measurements across multiple units of analysis. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and targeting treatments to the patients most likely to benefit from them. In contrast, biomarkers for psychiatric disorders remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of depression and anxiety in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific clinical profiles of anxiety, reward processing, and anxious arousal within these subtypes.",Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety,9733429,R56MH114976,"['Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stimulus', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Variant', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'approach avoidance behavior', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer therapy', 'connectome', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward processing', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2018,724068,227555357,0.019787080713316706
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9444775,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,735735,570146095,0.043264413096767894
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth ABSTRACT Only slightly more than half (55%) of 4-17 year olds with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment. These are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. Nearly half of children with known mental health disorders and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. This study aims to (a) develop methods based on electronic medical records data to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age and (b) conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children and adolescence. Phase 1 of the study would focus on the development and refinement of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify symptomatic 4-17 year olds with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s). The tool would identify patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Phase 2 of the study would focus on conducting a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). The navigator model to be implemented and tested will include three groups based on recent visits recorded in the electronic health record. Those with: (1) a new mental health diagnosis; (2) new mental health medication ordered, no mental health diagnosis; (3) no new mental health diagnosis or medication (symptoms identified by NLP tool). The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 bridging psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed, stay in contact with the family for 6 months. The primary outcome is percentage of youth with at least 4 psychotherapy visits in the 6 months following the initial visit. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with >=80% medication adherence over the 6 month follow up period. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use and medication adherence compared to the control arm. We will also assess medication adjustments, initiation of psychotherapy or medications, and (intervention arm only) change in self-efficacy in navigating the mental health care system over 6 months. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and adolescence yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) develop ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering social worker support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6 month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth,9752077,R56MH117767,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appointment', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Workers', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Wait Time', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'burden of illness', 'care providers', 'child mental health service', 'electronic registry', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment services', 'trial comparing', 'trial design', 'urgent care', 'usual care arm', 'waiver']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R56,2018,741297,111231681,-0.007739864535174143
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,44711126,0.031994034980690034
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9522326,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,798446,593605914,0.014171876514666577
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9509385,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2018,1000000,524978793,0.02692335168698315
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,329565273,-0.0063567681767173635
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,570146095,0.011887241320307206
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,560644462,0.03337690337481434
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,10556652,0.00907235753439157
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9395139,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2017,32309,61050884,0.021836059141404428
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9396350,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,35844,11430998,0.023769572059745055
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,113554200,0.003997938805534139
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9357677,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2017,76750,2132449,-0.023765803545587796
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,55098220,0.013974435850171864
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,68331629,0.03274164015776923
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9328159,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal behavior', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2017,139359,44711126,0.00895194729432681
"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD. The proposed research will provide new insights into the childhood ADHD and eventually aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatments for this disorder.",Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD,9297372,K01MH105625,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'experience', 'inattention', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,169014,560644462,-0.007966659838067913
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,304670088,-0.012250163056560782
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9384844,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2017,186151,551214295,0.006871074141935635
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9323594,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,192686,304670088,0.016203526154590798
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9334048,R21AG053467,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,193393,338121506,-0.06068344468534816
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9325617,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,347813,607172798,0.0012178060392502624
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.",PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES,9322565,R01HD076756,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catecholamines', 'Chronic disabling pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emotional', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genital system', 'Gossypium', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Interstitial Cystitis', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Neurobiology', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain Threshold', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Persistent pain', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Control', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Vestibulodynia', 'Visual', 'Vulva', 'Vulvodynia', 'Woman', 'allodynia', 'base', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder control', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'functional disability', 'gray matter', 'health related quality of life', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'illness length', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'phenotypic data', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'spatial integration', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,367961,673201228,0.004236387308758585
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9318580,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382414,50343425,0.009190624094806447
"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9320978,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'anti social', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,420351,524978793,0.00976185175904528
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,68331629,-0.012056673196320623
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,593605914,0.00437781141610876
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9296185,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,572607,641965656,0.027107176163397313
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,7903567,0.0005600915679868183
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,68331629,0.0023548752481689474
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9329487,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,1254231,570146095,0.011887241320307206
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,136810522,0.005606844242501907
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,65771974,0.019036043040758226
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,673201228,0.025707181910375354
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,338121506,0.025759870441715904
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,560644462,0.03337690337481434
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9242756,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2016,76750,2132449,-0.023765803545587796
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,673201228,0.04134611187817339
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,68331629,0.03274164015776923

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD. The proposed research will provide new insights into the childhood ADHD and eventually aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatments for this disorder.",Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD,9090153,K01MH105625,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'experience', 'inattention', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'social', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,169014,560644462,-0.007966659838067913
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'study characteristics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,45209062,0.0036622986372480235
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,246330700,0.013506796874882682
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9164777,R21AG053467,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,206644,338121506,-0.06068344468534816
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the “age of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the app’s technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY’s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9098673,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,326999,58504236,0.005610766819505779
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9314157,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2016,364740,44711126,0.00895194729432681
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0,0.01233237829221386
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,89938253,0.014446500788655512
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,68331629,-0.012056673196320623
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,50343425,0.009190624094806447
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,641965656,0.027107176163397313
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,593605914,0.00437781141610876
"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9160973,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Family Relationship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Robotics', 'Rodent', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'antisocial behavior', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mental health related disorder', 'model development', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'success', 'technique development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,517160,524978793,0.00976185175904528
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,9097801,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,562097,148463823,0.02895598754953752
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9049546,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'concept mapping', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'data access', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health service use', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'monitoring device', 'mood symptom', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'reduce symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,564995,524978793,0.025410009622352184
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,7903567,0.0005600915679868183
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Figs - dietary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,570146095,0.011887241320307206
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,136810522,0.005606844242501907
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,338121506,0.025759870441715904
"Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9067635,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,43567,524978793,0.025410009622352184
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,68331629,0.03274164015776923
"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD. The proposed research will provide new insights into the childhood ADHD and eventually aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatments for this disorder.            ",Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD,8967733,K01MH105625,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'experience', 'inattention', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,169714,560644462,-0.007966659838067913
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web-based social networking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,45209062,0.0036622986372480235
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,246330700,0.013506796874882682
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,89938253,0.014446500788655512
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity.

"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,68331629,-0.012056673196320623
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8892258,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,525858,524978793,0.025410009622352184
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,136810522,0.005606844242501907
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,30434536,0.002029943781468627
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,550947887,0.006185687035767884
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,607172798,0.0012178060392502624
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,77336088,0.005667476143132845
"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8698820,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,506032,524978793,0.025410009622352184
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,136810522,0.005606844242501907
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.                ","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8527041,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2013,52190,30434536,0.002029943781468627
"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.        The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8495026,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,506938,524978793,0.025410009622352184
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,148463823,0.02895598754953752
"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Agrammatism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Atrophic', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Functional Aphasias', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantic Dementias', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,161094826,-0.031952886974309466
"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.           The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,0,0.01220190690438334

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,91740242,0.013312468473388664
"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets.

"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,30434536,0.011350855593973948
"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006).

"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease and may suggest methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.             n/a",Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain,7471139,R21AG030445,"['Accounting', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Compatible', 'Complement component C1s', 'Comprehension', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Robin bird', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'improved', 'man', 'memory process', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2008,146800,45219910,-0.01380034083330065
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods.

"Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illness is a great burden for the affected individual and economically costly for society. The annual cost of mental disorders has been estimated to be $150 billion, increasing every year, and this total does not include more than three million people receiving disability benefits due to mental disorders. It is imperative that we prioritize research efforts focused on understanding brain function in order to improve diagnostic strategies and discover more effective therapies. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool to visualize and measure typical and atypical cognitive processing. However, many important cognitive processing systems, such as those associated with memory, language, emotion and executive control, only produce small BOLD signals and thus measurements are noisy and have low statistical confidence. Hence, fMRI has not been readily adopted for clinical diagnosis of individual patients. I propose to develop greatly improved methods to suppress the noise sources in fMRI data in order to transform fMRI from a research tool about populations to a consistent and accurate diagnostic tool to study individual cognitive functions. Using the strategy that every noise suppression algorithm must perform well to reliably detect single trial fMRI BOLD signals, I developed visualization methods to ""see"" deeply into fMRI data to evaluate the quality of the data at every step of fMRI data processing. The preliminary studies indicate that there are clear opportunities to improve fMRI image analysis techniques. The proposed research will first develop and test methods to improve suppression of errors from motion and physiological fluctuations. Then it will translate this research by combining these techniques with pattern recognition to characterize individual cognitive activation patterns in typical and atypical populations. My quantitative science expertise is in image processing, algorithm design, and pattern recognition. The research directly supports my interdisciplinary career development with hands-on experience in experiment planning, fMRI scanner operation, neuroscience coursework, and new software methods for application to severely brain disordered populations. In particular, the subjects for this research will include important clinical psychiatric populations with disorders such as fragile X syndrome, Turner syndrome, autism, Williams syndrome, depression, and bipolar disorder, so that all newly developed methods can be immediately put into practice.           n/a",Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis,7075928,K25MH077309,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'body movement', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'cognition disorders', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'developmental disease /disorder', 'dyslexia', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'learning disorders', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental retardation', 'patient oriented research']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,162340,560644462,0.0005661108921630974

"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD). The long-term research goal of this project continues to be the identification of genetics factors which predispose to the development and course of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The immediate goal of the current application is to test the discriminant validity of DSM-IV and latent class conceptualizations of ADHD subtypes on the stability, course and outcome of illness. During the initial funding period of this project we have developed an alternative DSM-IV nosology using latent class analysis. In contrast to DSM-IV ADHD subtypes, these new phenotypes appear to be genetically independent forms of ADHD. These studies utilized birth defects based identification of twins with ADHD symptomatology through a two-stage screening process.  In this current application we propose to conduct a 5- year follow-up study of 450 families identified through having a latent class or DSM-IV identified ADHD subtype. In addition to repeating the original evaluation assessment, families will also complete an enhanced set of interviews and questionnaires relating to family history, home environment and outcome measures. In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6819975,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', 'behavioral genetics', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'genetic models', 'genetic screening', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'mental health epidemiology', 'patient oriented research', 'questionnaires', 'twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,546341,533594881,-0.014310222172368069
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6725468,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'female', 'gonorrhea', 'human subject', 'interview', 'reproductive system infection', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'sign /symptom', 'urinalysis', 'urinary tract infection', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2004,74500,0,-0.0010103302082381809
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,0,0.011518793438969346

R33 Aims: 1.Use single-trial EEG-derived regressors, constructed via supervised machine learning, to construct efMRI activation maps (stEEG/fMRI activation maps) for auditory oddball and Eriksen flanker tasks. 2.Use alpha power as a complementary regressor within stEEG/fMRI for capturing additional single-trial variance in the hemodynamic response. 3.Demonstrate that stEEG/tMRI activations maps yield new information for discriminating young and old adult populations, as compared to traditional efMRI and P3 and ERN ERP analysis. n/a",A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System,6829951,R21EB004730,"['aging', 'auditory threshold', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'electroencephalography', 'evoked potentials', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'hemodynamics', 'human subject', 'learning', 'loudness', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'technology /technique development']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R21,2004,188133,61807989,-0.0031298008179571875
"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD). The long-term research goal of this project continues to be the identification of genetics factors which predispose to the development and course of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The immediate goal of the current application is to test the discriminant validity of DSM-IV and latent class conceptualizations of ADHD subtypes on the stability, course and outcome of illness. During the initial funding period of this project we have developed an alternative DSM-IV nosology using latent class analysis. In contrast to DSM-IV ADHD subtypes, these new phenotypes appear to be genetically independent forms of ADHD. These studies utilized birth defects based identification of twins with ADHD symptomatology through a two-stage screening process.  In this current application we propose to conduct a 5- year follow-up study of 450 families identified through having a latent class or DSM-IV identified ADHD subtype. In addition to repeating the original evaluation assessment, families will also complete an enhanced set of interviews and questionnaires relating to family history, home environment and outcome measures. In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6687818,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', 'behavioral genetics', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'genetic models', 'genetic screening', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'mental health epidemiology', 'patient oriented research', 'questionnaires', 'twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,621907,533594881,-0.014310222172368069
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6600325,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Trichomonas vaginalis', ' adolescence (12-20)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' female', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' interview', ' reproductive system infection', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' sign /symptom', ' urinalysis', ' urinary tract infection', "" women's health""]",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2003,74500,0,-0.0010103302082381809
"JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS This proposal responds to research topic 12 (Cognition in Context), with secondary relevance to topic 19 (Genetics, Behavior and Aging). The aging of the U.S. population has stimulated public health interest in identifying factors that can preserve the cognitive functioning of older adults. Complex work may be one activity that has a salutary effect on late-life cognitive function, but factors like intelligence, educational level, and early environmental exposures are potential confounds to this association. Twin studies allow for control of many of these confounding factors. The goal of this project is to determine whether occupational complexity is associated with better late-life cognitive functioning in a sample of elderly twins, using data collected by the Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging on members of the National Research Council-National Academy of Sciences (NAS-NRC) Registry of World War II veteran twins. Specific Aim 1 of this project is to classify each twin's primary lifetime occupation using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), from which a measure of complexity can be derived. This allows additional Specific Aims (SA) to be tested using co-twin control analyses: (SA 2) estimate the association between occupational complexity and cognitive status, (SA 3) estimate the association between occupational complexity and change in cognitive status over time, and (SA 4) estimate the extent to which intelligence moderates the relationship between occupational complexity and cognitive status. The study sample, which comprises approximately 1000 monozygotic and 1000 dizygotic twin pairs, has been administered a cognitive status examination every 3-4 years since 1990 as part of a screening and assessment protocol for dementia. Approximately 300 of these pairs also have scores on standard armed services intelligence tests. Logistic regression dependent on twin pair will be used to estimate association between a factor-based measure of occupational complexity from the DOT and either baseline (SA 2) or change scores (SA 3) from the cognitive status measure. Analyses for SA 4 will be similar, using the intelligence test score as a covariate. If occupational complexity is found to enhance late-life cognitive functioning, this modifiable factor could inform cognitive interventions and influence decisions about occupational activities and retirement. Follow-up twin studies can explore whether complex work is a protective factor for dementia. n/a",JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS,6684283,R03AG022683,"['aging', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' human data', ' human old age (65+)', ' intelligence tests', ' occupations', ' twin /multiplet', ' veterans']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,77000,607172798,-0.009491431735765738

"Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression Relatively little work has explored the role of stress and social rhythms (i.e., daily routines) as they impact the circadian system in depression. The goal of this project is to investigate a theoretical model describing pathways by which social factors may be related to depression via their impact on circadian rhythms. After meeting screening criteria, 40 depressed and 40 normal control participants will complete a life events interview.  They will be given actillumes (devices which measure sleep/wake activity) and prospective, daily measures of social interactions and mood to complete over a 1-week period of time.  For both groups, linear regression will be used to predict social and circadian rhythms from social rhythm disruption (SRD) life events that have occurred within the past 4 months.  Cross-sectional analyses utilizing linear and logistic regression will investigate the relationship between circadian and social rhythms and circadian rhythms and depression.  It is predicted that individuals with depression are more sensitive and less adaptive to changes in their environment as compared to non-depressed subjects.  This project will increase our understanding of psychosocial and biological interactions involved in major depressive disorder.  In addition, this study is likely to enhance understanding of the validity of social rhythms as a construct.  This line of research may provide guidelines for addressing circadian factors when developing interventions. n/a",Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression,6445959,F31MH064255,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bioperiodicity', ' body physical activity', ' circadian rhythms', ' clinical research', ' depression', ' emotions', ' human subject', ' interpersonal relations', ' interview', ' photobiology', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' psychological tests', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires', ' sleep', ' social psychology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,F31,2002,25018,0,-0.008957941866500825

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.
