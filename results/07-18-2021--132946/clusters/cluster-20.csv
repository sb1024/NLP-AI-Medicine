"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),9711286,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,802341,0.01928619757094282
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,0.06248363784457585
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9650406,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,410983,0.031960561813930755

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,0.05922567685714515
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9762876,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2019,168764,0.04284848469022515

The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,0.06248363784457585
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort - Diversity Supplement Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects.

"Phamarcogenomics of Statin Therapy (SUPPLEMENT) PARENT ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin-treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well- characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin- induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects 1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-18-008, our goal is to extend the validation and application of our data integration methodologies into Alzheimer’s disease research. This administrative supplement is designed to extend the work of the existing subaward to the University of Pennsylvania subcontract for the POST Informatics Core. The PGRN POST Informatics Core serves as the central hub for data sharing and coordination across the three POST projects in the PGRN P50 award. One of our jobs is annotating the extensive information that will be collected and providing analysis expertise to the projects as needed. However, to make great strides in scientific progress and ensure that the collective whole of the Center is greater than the sum of the parts, a key function of the Informatics Core is to serve as ‘The Integrator’ to combine these data and information. We and others have shown that integration of complementary omics-based data can provide emergent insights into biological processes compared to what can be learned through any single approach alone. The methods that we are developing to integrate data for statin pharmacogenomic phenotypes will be equally applicable in the area of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, recent emphasis on open data science by Alzheimer’s disease researchers provides ample data for us to interrogate our method. We have developed novel statistical analysis tools such as the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA), and data visualization tools, such as PhenoGram, both of which are designed to collect and combine information from diverse data sources. With these tools, we will leverage publicly available Alzheimer’s disease datasets to maximize the knowledge gleaned about disease risk for Alzheimer’s diseases. The methodologies that we have been developing as part of the PGRN POST award for the past 2.5 years are clearly applicable to the study of Alzheimer’s disease risk. An important validation step of the application of our methodologies is to apply them to different types of datasets and in different phenotypic areas. This administrative supplement focused on extended research into having an Alzheimer’s disease focus is a great mechanism to simultaneously allow us to validate our methodologies with different types of data and potentially identify important risk factors and pathways toward a better understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we may have the opportunity to identify cross biological implications due to the known pleiotropic relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9568724,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2018,169028,0.04284848469022515

The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9611100,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,81158,0.016446525152767143
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,0.06248363784457585
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9309793,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,406123,0.031960561813930755
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9452250,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrotoxic', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2017,169044,0.04284848469022515

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7791405,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2010,113132,0.11804721357257428
"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions. Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms. In mining the text from such online, new information about side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals will be discovered. This is highly important for the health of the public, as it stands to create the framework for an herbal sentinel network system.              Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms.

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7625039,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,536571,0.03179662937221916

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7208003,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K25,2007,103762,0.11804721357257428

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7240459,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,543226,0.03179662937221916

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),10093288,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,705459,0.01928619757094282
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,0.06248363784457585
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9881338,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395483,0.031960561813930755

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9994848,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2020,169884,0.04284848469022515
