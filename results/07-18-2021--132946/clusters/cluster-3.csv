"Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning to Improve Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency Hospital operating rooms (OR) are currently under tremendous pressure to maximize patient outcomes and safety while reducing costs. Hospitals that focus on disadvantaged socioeconomic populations are often further burdened to meet these growing demands with a significant lack of resources. The U.S. spent $2.6 trillion on healthcare in 2010 with 56% comprised of healthcare worker wages. Unlike virtually all other sectors, healthcare has experienced no gains in labor productivity over the last 20 years. A healthcare productivity crisis exists, as changing regulatory and insurance standards are complicating delivery of care and increasing documentation burden. Therefore, technology solutions, which use intelligent sensors to reduce manual burden and intelligent algorithms to navigate the complex healthcare operations and logistics, can solve significant unmet productivity challenges and allow clinical staff to focus on patient care, safety, and outcomes.  Operating rooms require a complex set of resources, planning, data entry and logistics. Accuracy, speed, and accessibility of information to support real-time changes to planned logistics and operational decision- making significantly impact patient outcomes and safety, clinician and patient satisfaction, and efficiency and cost savings. The operational target is to ensure the patient, surgeon, anesthesiologist, technicians, nurses, janitorial staff, equipment, instruments, supplies, rooms and beds are available at required times and locations. High stress clinical environments, which require dynamic information across stakeholders and resources to make timely and accurate decisions, can significantly benefit from automated sensor inputs and artificial intelligence to minimize manual burden. Therefore, the objective is to develop Whiteboard Coordinator (WC), a software command and control system for hospital operating rooms to reduce manual clinician burden, optimize efficiency, and allow a patient care focus. The technology will integrate sensors and machine learning to detect and track resources for planned surgical events, recognize deviations and delays, and update human, equipment, and facility resource allocation in real-time to maximize efficiency and information accessibility.  Significant innovation will differentiate WC from existing dashboard and electronic medical record (EMR) apps. First, an intelligent camera network and machine vision algorithms will automatically detect and update availability and location of OR resources. Secondly, software will automate existing manual documentation procedures that currently take up to 50% of clinician time. Third, while other systems are reactionary and focus on billing documentation, WC machine learning algorithms will facilitate care coordination and parallel workflow to maximize efficient and resource allocation. Finally, WC information will quickly be disseminated to all OR stakeholders (surgeons, nurses, technicians, janitorial staff, etc.) across multiple platforms and devices. Additionally, technology to optimize human and equipment resources can level the playing field for socioeconomic disparate locations to maximize limited resources on patient care and safety. ! Hospital operating rooms depend on accuracy, speed, and accessibility of information to support real-time changes to planned surgical logistics and operational decisions that significantly impact patient outcomes and safety, clinician and patient satisfaction, and efficiency and cost savings. The objective is to develop, deploy, and demonstrate feasibility of Whiteboard Coordinator, a software command and control system for hospital operating rooms to reduce manual clinician burden, optimize efficiency, and allow a patient care focus. The technology will integrate sensors and machine learning to detect and track resources for planned surgical events, recognize deviations and delays, and update human, equipment, and facility resource allocation in real-time to maximize efficiency and information accessibility.",Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning to Improve Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency,9773420,R43LM013026,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Day Surgery', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Interruption', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'Update', 'Wages', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'digital', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'scalpel', 'sensor', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NLM,"ARTISIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,224540,0.012362545816919573
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,-0.011424098755586035
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,0.03971179007246511
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,4.893279648394504e-05
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'environmental change', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,0.007158215312333734
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,0.010991538147604368
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,0.0439462804417743
"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,0.028319590218857986
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9767278,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,660597,0.01925708125691146
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome.",A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods,9808911,R21DK122229,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Update', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized management', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repository', 'risk benefit ratio', 'transplant centers', 'transplantation medicine']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,269258,-1.0871889724194423e-05
"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment. Our results will help provide a tool for two-way assistance by enabling caregivers to fully program, adjust and customize the system in order to support the individual with dementia with improved situational awareness and timely feedback in the home setting.",CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare,9656662,R15AG061833,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Route', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toothbrushing', 'United States', 'aging in place', 'built environment', 'care recipients', 'career', 'caregiving', 'cognitive change', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'model design', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'smart home', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user centered design', 'way finding', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIA,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY STILLWATER,R15,2019,437757,-0.006178496217862369
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9757500,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,-0.013648960037993041
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,9840429,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,739992,-0.012494588031340553
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs in order to reduce patients' suffering and improve quality of life.",Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,9746515,K23HL143181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'American', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Comorbidity', 'Consult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital services', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'physical symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'skills', 'study population', 'supportive environment', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,174140,0.06663963733756086
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9739179,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2019,119704,-0.016790415117711253
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,9809933,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2019,208632,-0.02207997960226221
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,9717557,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,268034,0.02092010598802235
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9659641,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,596772,0.014282681324320472
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9681489,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,108012,0.05149289810338981
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes).

"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. ! Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,9912034,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2019,225000,0.02606663925134008
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics Abstract Medical decision making in intensive care settings relies on complex biomedical information, collected in real time, to assist hospital staff in patient management and intervention decisions. In this context, machine learning (ML) applications applied to healthcare analytics have been shown to provide significant improvement in quality of care and overall efficiency in ICU operations. A number of challenges affect healthcare analytics, these are growing data sizes, increasingly heterogeneous data sources, data assurance, credibility and quality as well as the privacy of patient record interchange. Current approaches to healthcare analytics are predominantly reliant on desktop and cloud computing architectures. These traditional systems exhibit high-latency, high-power requirements, and are overall inefficient for advanced analytic applications. If we hope to leverage the benefits of growing data size and heterogeneity, a new hardware paradigm for real time, secure and reliable ML in the clinic is needed. A potential for great innovation in medical big data applications is to imbue more analytic capability into smaller devices that sit closer to the source of data. This so-called edge computing will be instrumental in future medical applications, where real-time, low-latency, low-power computational tools are likely to dramatically improve the feasibility of remote monitoring and intensive monitoring applications, ultimately improving health outcomes. Lucid Circuit, Inc. is developing a line of purpose-built edge-analytics processors called AstrumTM. AstrumTM is an energy-efficient runtime-adaptable processor for reliable high-performance computing and low-power applications. AstrumTM processors benefit from an adaptable compute fabric that combines runtime-reconfigurable architecture and in-silicon security features. AstrumTM processors are designed to supports evolving analytics algorithms. In this proposal, we seek to optimize state of the art ML algorithms for signal processing, data quality monitoring and safe data interchange in remote and intensive-monitoring medical applications at the edge using AstrumTM. In phase II, we seek to develop an analytics programming ecosystem within which developers can customize signal quality metrics and prediction rules at a high level of abstraction, using popular analytics programming platforms. Ultimately, the work proposed in this application will enable the development of a new generation of edge-based precision intensive care and mobile health devices, together with a programming toolkit for customization, tuning, and development of ML algorithms that best match the needs of researchers, patients, and healthcare providers. Project Narrative Machine Learning (ML) applications to medical big data, have been shown to provide improved quality of care in intensive care settings. Their implementation in the clinic is currently limited by reliance on obsolete desktop and cloud computing architectures. By leveraging our experience with purpose-built AstrumTM processors, we propose to adapt state of the art analytics for computation at the edge, aiming to deliver edge-based precision intensive care analytics capabilities to a new generation of intensive care and mobile health devices.",EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics,9778345,R43NR018623,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Cloud Computing', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'System', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'operation', 'patient privacy', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINR,"LUCID CIRCUIT, INC.",R43,2019,149985,0.0078105936011310636
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The proposed study will produce a personalized (“precision”)-medicine tool using big data to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions for prescribing statins that will maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and statin-associated symptoms.",Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data,9684080,R01HL143390,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Care Costs', 'Holidays', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Life', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insurance claims', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,782736,-0.002741575797967493
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9738886,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,640937,-0.009107884029945333
"Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management ABSTRACT Despite the over 90% efficacy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment, it continues to be the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans. Over 30 million adults in the US have diabetes. Of these, 28% will develop DR and 4.4% will develop vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Currently, less than half of all patients with diabetes receive the recommended annual dilated eye exam and, of those diagnosed with VTDR, only 30% undergo timely treatment. New screening protocols are increasing screening effectiveness, however, even if every patient is screened, the majority of those at increased risk do not receive evidence-based follow-up care; a classic public health failure common to population-based screening. With expertise in health systems engineering and ophthalmology, the research team is uniquely suited to eliminate the root causes of this failure; resulting in a new, comprehensive care model designed to prevent blindness for the 8.9 million Americans with DR. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI)’s focus is on eliminating blindness by applying targeted care coordination for patients at increased risk for VTDR; ensuring they progress through the care path to treatment. However, two significant deficiencies weaken RCI’s ability to deliver effective care coordination. The first is insufficient capacity due to coordinating care for 35% of all patients, though less than 5% actually have VTDR. This derives from the low positive predictive value of the current system, based on a handheld electroretinography and pupillography device deployed in a primary care setting. The first aim is to improve the ability to classify a patient as low- risk for VTDR, thereby reducing the care coordination burden and improving quality and effectiveness. Aim 1: Improve the ability to accurately identify patients at increased risk for VTDR by including patient  health and demographic attributes in a machine learning based predictive algorithm for VTDR diagnosis.  Patient clusters will be identified (a) and used to create sub-population specific risk models (b). The second deficiency is the lack of adherence to follow-up and treatment after identification as increased risk for VTDR. Once a patient is identified as increased risk, the care coordination of the RCI DR program has averaged over five phone calls per patient to achieve follow-up with an eye care provider. The second aim is to identify and eliminate these barriers to coordinated care between patient and provider. Aim 2 Apply text analytics and simulation to improve access, compliance, cost, and equity by enhancing care coordination, from diagnosis to treatment, for patients at increased risk for VTDR. The application of data analytics and systems engineering methods to integrate and improve each critical component of the care path, access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment, will enable a paradigm shift in DR treatment. RCI’s platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model by delivering a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end solution for diabetic retinopathy care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting 8.9 million Americans, is the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans, yet, blindness is preventable in 90% of the cases with timely detection and treatment. To reach the 30 million adults living with diabetes in the US, the Retinal Care DR platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model via a first-of- its-kind end-to-end solution for DR care implementable in any care setting. This will be accomplished via the application of data analytics (machine learning and statistical analysis) and systems engineering (sentiment analysis and simulation) methods to integrate and improve each of the three critical components of the care path: access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment.",Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management,9679729,R41EY029917,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroretinography', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Service delivery model', 'Severities', 'Social Workers', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'care providers', 'classification trees', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model design', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'pupillography', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sociodemographics']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2019,219356,0.014155749022759914
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.0067350758106722915
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,0.013886547562137365
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9748417,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,991540,0.004057307023411911
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG. This project seeks to demonstrate the benefit of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), a quantitative and objective angle assessment method, and develop anterior segment OCT-based methods for the clinical evaluation of patients with PACD.",Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease,9646939,K23EY029763,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Aqueous Humor', 'Area', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epidemiology', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gonioscopy', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lasers', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma', 'Primary Health Care', 'Pupil', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractive Errors', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Trabecular meshwork structure', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Width', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'standardized care', 'targeted treatment']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2019,228758,-0.0014660230221949285
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases,9778356,R43NR018631,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Environment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research Personnel', 'Self Assessment', 'Self-Examination', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical decision support', 'computational intelligence', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'invention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'urgent care']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R43,2019,149999,0.009505228171688352
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9722313,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,658069,0.019350973811723383
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9768542,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2019,205524,-0.010429907287340404
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9882887,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2019,37193,0.00904794746859577
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2019,130618,0.005739104434456296
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9750788,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,807787,0.011678042570028607
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness. We hypothesize the intervention will improve outcomes for older patients with chronic illness and their family members and will be effective in the expanding subset of these patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness,9708591,R01AG062441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'base', 'care costs', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'patient subsets', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'symposium', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,777399,-0.04800028093261304
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9742306,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126700,-0.0005344719370114189
"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9626417,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,616807,-0.014214787222323683
"Personalized multimedication packaging with integrated real-time instrumentation to improve adherence Abstract Approximately 23% of Americans take 3 or more prescription medications, often as a part of complex drug regimens that challenge adherence, contributing to treatment failures and costing US healthcare $100 billion or more, annually. Difficulties managing polypharmacy negatively impact all stakeholders – patients, doctors, pharmacies and insurers. The problem is particularly significant in elder-care, as the likelihood of developing chronic conditions treatable by medication increases and multiple characteristics of this population pose assorted risks for medication errors. Custom multimedication packaging has shown promise in addressing some of the drivers of non-adherence, but offers no solution for other drivers such as errors in drug reconciliation, healthcare practitioner involvement, care coordination and patient education. The multiple stakeholders in medication prescribing and utilization practices constitute a variety of potential sources of medication management problems, but also a diverse set of clients for polypharmacy solutions. Insightfil is developing a comprehensive medication management solution that incorporates convenience packaging with passive detection of medication adherence to provide essential and medicine-related information in real-time generating a channel for more accurate information exchange between all stakeholders for improved patient care and satisfaction. In previous work, we designed, built and tested a robotic workstation that offers innovative patient drug packaging, which is unique in its ability to avoid medication cross-contamination. Leveraging our successful launch of the medication dispensing robot, the goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop instrument pill pouches and use the resulting real- time adherence data to improve the way patients are nudged into increased adherence through more personalized and context-specific communications. Toward this end we propose Specific Aims to develop three components of the technology: 1) a near-field communication (NFC) sensor that is compatible with the emerging industry standard for custom fill convenience packaging; 2) a smartphone app that reads the NFC tags to verify that a medication pack has been opened; and 3) a smartphone app to deliver real-time, context sensitive patient messaging based on medication use patterns. Once the prototype system is developed, we will conduct a pilot study (Specific Aim 4) of 30 multimedication users to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of Insightfil's platform technology. After establishing proof-of-concept through the completion of the SBIR Phase I project, we will refine the resulting prototype technology into a more robust commercial grade system with an expanded-features patient app ready for pilot deployment in 1-2 pharmacies serving 5,000 patients (Phase II). Significantly, the research design required for commercialization will not require FDA approval for deployment in pharmacies - Pharmacists will follow all regulations applicable to the dispensing of medications.

"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data.

"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9815239,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,598123,0.021429846506566198
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,-0.0510318376789971
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,-0.005350210118765078
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9749124,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,283296,0.033695470185539686
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9776462,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,1606082,0.017339483065984616
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.026217274263158966
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9652672,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,172087,-0.008142047720075183
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,0.044538537313642004
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,-0.026167949057315898
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9748454,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,363081,0.0402865537513929
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators.

"Changing Talk Online (CHATO): A Pragmatic Trial to Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia Care ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. NARRATIVE The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the critical need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R61/R33 pragmatic clinical trial will test interactive online communication training for nursing home staff to reduce ineffective elderspeak communication, with anticipated reductions in behavioral symptoms and inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in residents with dementia.

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,0.03416622127545858
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9687744,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2019,143581,0.001991945261461464
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9769695,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,256000,-0.0011060683162312135
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,9927810,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right to Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prospective', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,238522,0.014441921096328912
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.009453548561708458

"Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors program (SyMon-SAYS) for children with cancer in decreasing patients’ symptom burden, decreasing parent-perceived barriers in managing their child’s symptoms, increasing patients’ and parents’ self-efficacy and increasing patients’ quality of life.

"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9735244,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2019,494501,0.009133862088204143
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9649217,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'automated reasoning', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2019,116529,0.023397130816429274
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes.

"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9789806,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,525499,0.024729373224187078
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9730300,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2019,646905,0.0034452958639958463
"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.",SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,9755271,U01CK000557,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2019,800379,0.01745606890412031
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research.

"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities. Contact networks have been a major focus of epidemiological studies of infection transmission, but much more work has been done in community populations than in healthcare settings. Our goal is to advance understanding how diseases can spread within long term care facilities and to enhance our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different infection control interventions.",Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities,9753063,U01CK000555,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2019,720485,0.01734077463470577
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9659038,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'effectiveness research', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,492573,0.02685665574555349
"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",9919215,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,915143,0.022458038089634605
"Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF The goal of this proposal is to develop accurate, generalizable and interpretable predictive models based on electronic health records (EHR) that detect heart failure (HF) in primary care patients one to two years before a clinical diagnosis and to translate the models for use in clinical care. Case-control datasets from two large US health systems (i.e., >13,000 incident HF cases and >120,000 controls) will be created and used to address two of the three study aims. For Aim 1 (Improve prediction of pre-diagnostic HF and model generalizability), recursive neural network (RNN) models will be used to improve prediction accuracy when compared to prior work that was based on traditional machine learning models (e.g., random forest, lasso logistic regression). It is expected that RNN models will perform better because temporality of EHR events can be captured. Aim 1 will also focus on improving model generalizability (i.e., among patients within and across health systems) by leveraging RNN models and by addressing challenges caused by variation in patient level EHR data (e.g., density of data) that are independent of a patient's actual health status. Aim 2 (Identify and clinically validate pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes) will focus on the identification of pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes and the use of content from RNN models derived under Aim 1. Three levels of analysis will be completed. First, we will focus on pathophysiologic heterogeneity that is represented, in part, by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). But, HFpEF is considered to be more heterogeneous than HFrEF. New methods will be developed to reliably identify pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes. Second, phenotypes will be clinically validated for reliability and coherence and compared to clinical judgement based on a review of the patient's record. Third, we will address a challenge with RNN models, as they generate “black box” solutions that are seemingly uninterpretable. We propose to develop new methods to extract and represent the content from RNN models. We hypothesize that when phenotype status is combined with information extracted from Aim 1 RNN models it will be judged by expert clinician reviews to be superior for prevention care to phenotype status when it is combined with information extracted from traditional machine learning models or to a direct review of the patient's EHR. Finally, we will prospectively validate the phenotype and RNN models using a large primary care cohort being created by Sutter and related serial biobanked blood samples. For aim 3 we will determine how accurately the models predict elevated biomarker levels that are known to be sensitive and specific indicators of HF disease progression.   The proposed research will contribute valuable knowledge that will assist doctors to identify patients who are at high-risk of incident heart failure 12 to 24 months before the actual diagnosis and that exceed what is possible when relying on traditional signs, symptoms or risk factors. Doctors will be able to provide a more targeted approach to reduce the future risk of heart failure and the risks of morbidity and accelerated mortality that high risk patients face. Moreover, the methods that are developed for the early detection of heart failure in this study will help other researchers in creating more accurate and generalizable predictive models when using electronic health records data and when applying these models for use in clinical care.  ",Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF,9779100,R56HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Face', 'Feeds', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Stretching', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Troponin T', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'density', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'recursive neural network']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R56,2018,761303,0.00045422793829290027
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,-0.011424098755586035
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.03971179007246511
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,0.0439462804417743
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.0197111893428347
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital.

"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identifies clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,-0.004302166896978011
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,0.008565373268159066
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy.

"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9582115,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2018,120139,-0.016790415117711253
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,0.010991538147604368
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9505095,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,105743,0.05149289810338981
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9577245,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,1329765,0.004057307023411911
"Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 1.6 million patients undergo interhospital transfer (IHT) each year in the United States. Of those IHTs, approximately 550,000 are conducted by air (i.e., helicopters or jets), or roughly one every 60 seconds, at an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. Contrary to common belief, patients who undergo IHT experience worse outcomes, which include double the length of stay, twice the cost, and higher mortality than non- transferred patients. While worse outcomes are not necessarily due to higher severity of illness, factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes have yet to be identified. For about 30% of the patients experiencing an immediately life-threatening condition such as trauma or heart attack, immediate IHT by air is beneficial; but for the other 70% of patients not experiencing a life-threatening condition, the benefit is less clear.  The current decision-making process regarding who should be transferred and how (air vs. ground) is rarely guided by evidence or guidelines. Furthermore, patients and families rarely have input regarding how a patient is transferred. Empirical evidence is needed to identify meaningful indicators for IHT and to guide the decision regarding mode of transfer. Previous research efforts relied almost exclusively on data from the post- transport phase of illness, a major limitation when investigating what leads up to a patient needing transfer to another hospital. To investigate the factors that lead to IHT, we developed a data repository for patients who are transported from one hospital to another. This repository includes the electronic medical record of helicopter and jet transfers, as well as the sending and receiving hospital EMR data.  The purpose of this study is to model complex patient-centered data that may predict those patients that will benefit from IHT by identifying pre-transport electronic phenotypes, and to determine who will benefit from air versus ground transfer. To fully leverage the data repository, this study will employ a data science approach that leverages statistical learning techniques to achieve the following aims: 1) Identify and rank specific combinations of comorbidities, active medical problems, and physiologic instability indicators according to frequency and impact on post-IHT mortality, and 2) Identify electronic phenotypes of IHT patients that benefit from air transfer according to health outcomes (hospital discharge status and functional status). After conducting exploratory data analysis and reducing variables with repeated measures, we will employ Association Rules to identify significant combinations of covariates to include in final model development (Aim 1). Then in Aim 2 we will use Random Forest to identify the most impactful variables from all of the available variables that will be analyzed via Classification and Regression Tree to identify distinct subgroups of patients that benefit from IHT by air transport. The individual characteristics identified from this data driven approach will provide the evidence needed to support future applications to develop clinical decision support for use by clinicians, patients, and families when making transfer decisions. Project Narrative Air Medical Transport (AMT), the use of helicopters and jets to transfer patients from one hospital to another, has been shown to save lives for patients with immediately life threatening conditions such as trauma or heart attack; for patients not experiencing an emergency, the impact of using AMT and transferring is unknown. To increase our understanding of the impact that AMT has for patients not experiencing an emergency, we will identify the patient characteristics and transport factors that improve patient survival after transport. Our study will be the first to provide evidence to support informed conversations between patients, families, and providers to guide those making the difficult decisions of if and how to transfer to another hospital.",Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients,9515376,R15NR017792,"['Address', 'Air', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Helicopter', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'School Nursing', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'forest', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'repository', 'support tools']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,150000,0.014560307441897603
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules.

"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9502383,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,658069,0.019350973811723383
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9419932,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,623932,-0.014214787222323683
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9567692,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,883091,0.011678042570028607
"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia.

"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9504995,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2018,205524,-0.010429907287340404
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,-0.005350210118765078
"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9547377,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,285285,0.033695470185539686
"A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness Project Summary/Abstract:  A growing number of older adults in the United States who are near the end of life are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with acute critical illness and receive invasive medical treatments. The use of prolonged life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation for older adults near death is common and increasing over time. However, most older adults report end-of-life care preferences to prioritize their comfort and quality of life near death over burdensome life-sustaining treatments. To make medical treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life-care preferences, patients and their surrogates require meaningful prognostic information in the setting of an acute illness. However, traditional prognostic tools for critically ill patients have focused on estimating patients' risk of death. Patients and surrogates often struggle to interpret or use mortality estimates for decision making, and the dichotomous outcome of mortality fails to describe the longitudinal trajectory of a patient's illness. We hypothesize that a novel tool that incorporates longitudinal prognostic information and a more descriptive account of potential outcomes will help patients, surrogates, and ICU physicians make treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life care preferences.  The central goals of this NRSA Individual Fellowship are to (1) facilitate the candidate's career development into an independent, successful health services researcher in critical care medicine and (2) address the disparity between end-of-life medical care that is delivered in the United States and patients' goals values, and preferences. The candidate and her mentors have designed a training plan to accomplish these goals that includes two specific research objectives. First, we aim to create a novel, longitudinal predictive model for critically ill adults that characterizes the expected trajectory of medical treatments over time and a description of the patient's likely outcome. To accomplish our first objective, we will apply the innovative tools of predictive analytics from the field of engineering (i.e. robust machine learning) to a large EHR-derived clinical database of all admissions to an adult medical ICU over 3 years (N ≈ 3,000 patients). The predictive model will characterize discrete, temporal patterns of patients' exposure to medical treatments during an ICU stay (“illness trajectories”) and describe the outcomes of patients who follow each trajectory. Second, we plan to use the output of our predictive model to design a user-centered prognostic tool for clinical use. Using both real and hypothetical output from our predictive model, we will engage critically ill patients (if able to participate), their surrogate decision-makers, and critical care clinicians to design and iteratively revise a prognostic tool that presents longitudinal data. The stakeholders will participate in qualitative interviews and focus groups to provide feedback about the content, format, and usability of the tool for treatment decisions in the ICU. This study will lead to the prototype of a novel, patient-centered prognostic tool that is designed to better align treatment decisions in the ICU with patients' end-of-life care preferences. Project Narrative Many critically ill patients and their families are confronted with a decision between life-prolonging but burdensome treatments or comfort-focused medical care that may lead to an earlier death. These decisions can be very difficult when there is uncertainty about whether the patient can recover and what the patient's life will be like during the illness and recovery. To help with these difficult decisions, we propose a study to design a new tool to help patients, families, and ICU clinicians predict the range of possible outcomes for an individual patient.","A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness",9467697,F32HL140824,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Interviews', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'care preference', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient oriented', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prototype', 'skills', 'surrogate decision maker', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,59886,-0.018187312611682317
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study av- erage effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and beneﬁt of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Speciﬁcally, under Aim 1, we will develop a uniﬁed framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reﬂect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efﬁcient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide se- quential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus beneﬁts when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing beneﬁt to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efﬁcient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient pop- ulation will be beneﬁcial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9566413,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,1527723,0.017339483065984616
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9461433,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172087,-0.008142047720075183
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9488582,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,375284,0.0402865537513929

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9678555,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,658716,0.03416622127545858
"Planning Changing Talk Online (CHATO): a Clinical Trial Testing the Effects of Online Communication Training for Nursing Home Staff on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Residents with Dementia Abstract  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk, which is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This 1-year R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant will prepare for a future clinical trial (in response to PA- 17-014, Addressing Unmet Needs in Persons with Dementia to Decrease Behavioral Symptoms and Improve Quality of Life) that will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD in 120 NHs. The R34 project will orient our multidisciplinary research team to address new aims; recruit and enroll NHs; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, study documents, and data forms; solidify plans for data management and sharing and fidelity assurance, and obtain IRB approvals. The feasibility of an elderspeak feedback app for staff that may improve CHATO effects will also be demonstrated in the NH to prepare for the clinical trial.  In the planned R01 clinical trial, 120 NHs will be randomized to the CHATO training group or to the control group. BPSD data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs for various approaches will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NINR's symptom management and caregiver support missions, NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The potential for reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD will be explored, addressing the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. Narrative The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R34 clinical trial planning grant will prepare for a future clinical trial testing online interactive communication training for nursing home staff that reduces ineffective elderspeak communication and behavioral and psychological symptoms of persons with dementia.

"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9608453,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,295209,-0.0011060683162312135
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9502161,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,143581,0.001991945261461464
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.

"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9554957,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'human error', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'secondary endpoint', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2018,1224065,0.0376169490172554
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,0.026097744794410987
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered

"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9571470,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2018,492523,0.009133862088204143
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9422711,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2018,253856,0.023397130816429274
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9526083,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2018,148403,0.03555731573256517
"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9683680,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,569374,0.024729373224187078
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9535814,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2018,649871,0.0034452958639958463
"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.",SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,9659740,U01CK000557,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2018,941762,0.01745606890412031

"Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This F32 fellowship award will provide Dr. Erica Farrand with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented clinical research in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (2) to develop a unique skill set in collecting, analyzing and interpreting real-world data; (3) to gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics and data science methods to conduct clinical research; (4) to advance the IPF field by improving our understanding of the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF. To achieve these goals, Dr. Farrand will conduct clinical investigations in two distinct healthcare systems, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). IPF is a progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality and over $1 billion in healthcare cost annually. Acute exacerbation of IPF, is an acute respiratory deterioration and arguably the most clinically significant event in the natural history of the disease. The fundamental aim of this NRSA proposal is to leverage the electronic health records of UCSF Health and KPNC to generate real-world evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute exacerbation of IPF, the nature and variability of its clinical management and health care utilization across settings, and the impact of common management strategies on clinical outcomes. Research in this fellowship will utilize electronic health record data to define the acute exacerbation population using a case-validated diagnostic algorithm (Aim 1), document the scope and impact of acute exacerbation on clinical practice and healthcare resource utilization, comparing the UCSF and KPNC systems (Aim 2), and determine the association of common management approaches with hospital based and short-term patient-outcomes (Aim 3). This project will demonstrate the power of leveraging high-quality electronic health record data to both advance our understanding of a clinical condition and document the association of treatment interventions with patient and system level outcomes NARRATIVE Episodes of acute respiratory deterioration known as acute exacerbations are the most clinically significant events in the natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and limited data exist to guide the management of acute exacerbations of IPF. The impact of acute exacerbations on health care resource utilization across health care settings has not been characterized. Leveraging high-quality real-world data from the electronic health records of two large medical systems, we will address this knowledge gap by defining the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF on the patient and healthcare system level; this work will demonstrate the power of real-world data for clinical research, and lay the foundation for future pragmatic studies of IPF.",Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap,9610527,F32HL143920,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulation', 'Award', 'Bilateral', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Management', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'System', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'day length', 'disease natural history', 'effectiveness trial', 'electronic data', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care service utilization', 'health care settings', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'prognostic', 'prospective test', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'survival outcome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,71077,0.01327380509349387
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority.

"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities.

"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9490424,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,653490,0.0009417309231064858
"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9272400,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2017,188594,0.007000253028120078
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,-0.00875987583711684
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,0.03971179007246511
"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasi- experimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations,9346982,DP2MD012722,"['Apgar Score', 'Birth Weight', 'Cause of Death', 'Confusion', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'High-Income Populations', 'Household', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'United States', 'analytical tool', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tool']",NIMHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP2,2017,1378477,0.023223602442665796
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9427058,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,698661,0.01925708125691146
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,0.0439462804417743
"Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Longitudinal Electronic Health Records and Applications to Heart Failure Prediction   PROJECT  SUMMARY  Heart failure (HF) is a highly disabling and costly disease with a high mortality rate. In the pre­diagnostic phase  (i.e.,  12­36  months  before  diagnosis),  HF  is  difficult  to  detect  given  the  insidious  signs  and  symptoms.  After  diagnosis,  where  it  is not possible to reverse disease progression, efforts are made to avoid hospital admission  and  re­admission,  but  with  limited  capabilities  to  stratify  patients  by  risk.  We  propose  to  develop  interpretable  deep learning models applied to large­scale electronic health record (EHR) data to detect HF related events on  two  different  time  scales.  One  set  of  models will be developed to detect HF diagnosis one to two years before  actual  documented  diagnosis.  Separately,  we  propose  to  identify  HF  patients  who  are  at  risk  of  hospital  admission  and  readmission . The project focuses on developing deep learning models that offer the potential for  greater  accuracy,  clinical  interpretability,  and  utility  than  alternatives.  The  expected  deliverables  include  comprehensive  software  for  creating  deep  learning  algorithms  that  predict  HF  outcomes  and  related  software  tools  for  model  visualization.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning has shown tremendous success in many domains but is yet to have similar impact in health care. The key challenges in healthcare applications are the lack of interpretation for deep learning models and limited transferability of the models across institutions.

"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Event', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scheduling and Staffing', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'falls', 'human-in-the-loop', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'time use', 'willingness']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,0.013789618454832016
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9341533,R44HL132622,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Update', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care service', 'health data', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'scale up', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'tool', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2017,849047,0.0035863765982707455
"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,-0.05476413552128099
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an “app” from an “app store” that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9357725,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,687081,0.019350973811723383
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9239711,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,735263,-0.014214787222323683
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,-0.005350210118765078
"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9336291,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,287228,0.033695470185539686
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9335418,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,490059,0.033650780170371736
"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasiexperimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations,10240136,DP2MD012722,[' '],NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2017,1164023,0.023470740750992786
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,0.026217274263158966
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9292908,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory health']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,172444,-0.008142047720075183
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,0.03416622127545858
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,0.01893518582195415
"Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ‘bundled’ approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning. NARRATIVE This SBIR Phase 1 application seeks to create then use a dataset of predictor variables and outcomes from mechanically ventilated patients to develop novel analytical tools that predict whether individual ventilated patients will develop delirium, ventilator associated conditions, and pneumonia. This information will improve patient outcomes and facilitate clinical decision-making by nurses and physicians by drawing their attention and resources to the patients most likely to develop these conditions.",Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting,9402876,R43NR015721,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Work of Breathing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'forest', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'model design', 'model development', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NINR,"ORIGENT DATA SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2017,75665,0.03682509711073755
"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.",The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging,9296180,R01LM012355,"['Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypoglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Insulin', 'Internet', 'Linguistics', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Series', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'communication aid', 'critical period', 'design', 'ethnic diversity', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'literate', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'safety net', 'service utilization', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'uptake']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,612234,0.031255005017685
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9297324,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,404000,0.003613189895884507
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,-0.01639465288118134
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,9115682,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Work Ethic', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,198331,0.030677028889897626
"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9348493,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Employee Strikes', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,1685221,0.0376169490172554
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,-0.009126945447231624
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,0.006383737804852569
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,0.026097744794410987

In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will advance public health by developing new CAHPS survey items for end-of-life care, shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety, promoting use of CAHPS surveys by implementing and evaluating an interactive database tool designed to assist with the assembly of CAHPS surveys, creating parsimonious variants of CAHPS surveys, evaluating alternative methods of data collection designed to improve response rates, enhancing the collection and use of patient narrative data in reports about health care, and assessing the impact of CAHPS surveys and reports on quality improvement efforts and patient experiences with care.",Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V),9491282,U18HS025920,[' '],AHRQ,RAND CORPORATION,U18,2017,1182529,0.0292677697351521
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9231462,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data resource', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2017,253856,0.023397130816429274
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9348609,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2017,158609,0.034487368681246654
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",9023329,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,200000,0.033015785127733004
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9420097,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2017,649361,0.0034452958639958463
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses.

The pressing clinical research needs addressed by VERITY include: a) integration of patients’ point of view (patient-centeredness); b) facilitation of innovative trials; c) incorporation of state of the art comparative effectiveness research methods to determine optimal treatments; d) development and testing of innovative behavioral interventions; and e) identification of relevant phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of common and uncommon rheumatic and MSK diseases using electronic medical records (EMRs), registries, cohorts and insurance claims.","VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics",9413618,P30AR072577,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harvest', 'Health Technology', 'Hospitals', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Lupus', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'behavioral economics', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'distributed data', 'effectiveness research', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment strategy']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P30,2017,907543,0.004486002543102364
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death.

"Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics. Furthermore, if a course of antibiotics are chosen to be administered, it is not clear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. This results in a blanket antibiotics approach, where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary. Procalcitonin (PCT) has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and viral infections. Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received 510k clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics. In addition, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria are often used as rough indications of a global inflammatory problem in patients. Of these four criteria (WBC count, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature), only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs. A handheld device that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in 10 minutes could revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings. In particular, obtaining the first measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical. Ideally this would be obtained in the most common “funnels” into the acute care EDs, including outpatient, ambulatory, and nursing home settings. Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics. For example, Roche’s Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day 0 and day 4, and that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised $1.7M in investment and has licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a hand-held electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts, cell surface receptor expression levels, and plasma protein expression levels. Our first cartridge will measure a total WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood. The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement (JDA) with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies (FIT) to co-develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand- held readers (letter attached). In addition, ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with hospitals to perform clinical studies (letters attached) to build a unique combined biomarker/EMR dataset. This dataset, when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient’s latest biomarker readings, will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient’s overall “immune state score”. This score could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic event, which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback. In this project, we will adapt our core technology, which has focused on cell measurements, to enable plasma protein measurements as well. In addition, we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker + EMR dataset at three clinical sites, University of Chicago Main Hospital, Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint Francis (OSF) hospital.

Measurement of the blood biomarkers combined with a predictive analytics machine learning approach will accurately capture the patient’s immune state as a progression of recovery from an adverse event. This system, consisting of a device to measure biomarkers rapidly from blood and a machine learning algorithm, could provide real time feedback to physicians describing an individual patient’s specific response to the administered antibiotics. This could help to eliminate unnecessary antibiotics while the pathogen is being identified and to de-escalate the antibiotics at higher susceptibility to resistance much faster.",Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations,9410203,R43CK000521,[' '],NCEZID,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R43,2017,150000,0.023288420544609265
"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.        ",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9112492,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2016,225750,0.007000253028120078
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,0.03971179007246511
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,9059748,R01GM097117,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Books', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fraud', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunosuppression', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer grid', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'digital', 'dosage', 'field study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'response', 'success', 'thiopurine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,394118,0.022245493737101097
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

This is an initial step in establishing a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive neurostimulative or pharmacological therapies.",Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning,9065664,R01NS092882,"['Acute', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Device Designs', 'Dose', 'Drug Exposure', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Focal Seizure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychological Impact', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'clinically relevant', 'empowered', 'hands-on learning', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'training aid']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,595775,0.021523645618792275
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,9025565,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2016,409330,-0.028395311405140778
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9147610,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,190216,0.0439462804417743
"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation. This STTR proposal focuses on quantification of an athlete's risk for, and recovery from, lower extremity injury.                ",A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes,9046038,R41AR068202,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Biomechanics', 'Boxing', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Occupational Health', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Games', 'Workplace', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'ligament injury', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'movement analysis', 'neuromuscular function', 'physical therapist', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'stressor', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'volunteer']",NIAMS,"BIONIKS, INC.",R41,2016,215600,-0.013472430751853844
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).            ",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9103405,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Boxing', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staff Work Load', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,656467,0.019350973811723383
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),9066173,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'learning strategy', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'predict clinical outcome', 'processing speed', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'search engine', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,507805,0.008686876275319295
"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.            ",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9145732,R01DK108073,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2016,292485,0.033695470185539686
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9202845,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2016,1009410,0.033650780170371736
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary As United States healthcare seeks to address inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost, data and technology have become central to all suggested approaches. With newly available electronic health data and massive growth in processing power, the hardest challenges in using clinical data are becoming clear. Big data holds the potential to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value-based payment models. However, it also creates challenges in discriminating accurate data from inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the greatest areas of data inaccuracy is the patient phenotype, or clinical description of the patient. Every clinical decision support tool, population health management system, and payment reform product relies on accurate electronic patient descriptions as its source data. But, the descriptions are not accurate, most notably in terms of completeness and granularity. Recall often falls below 50% in describing a patient’s medical conditions, such as heart failure and cancer. Detailed descriptions such as low ejection fraction heart failure or stage III breast cancer, needed for downstream analytics, are lacking in the discrete record. Poor data puts care delivery, payment reform, and population health efforts in peril. The time is right for technology to proactively define the clinical phenotype from source data, without reliance on current manual approaches. This will necessitate overcoming challenges in harmonizing discrepant narrative and discrete data, inferring when a characteristic such as cough is a primary condition versus symptom of another condition, and screening noise from signal in robust narrative text. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will include the following specific aims: 1. Create the components required to define an accurate and comprehensive clinical phenotype,  including: (i) extract problem, medication, procedure, and lab features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP) and ontologic mapping, (ii) build a large knowledge database  of associated clinical conditions, and (iii) assess extracted features against the knowledge  database to accurately distinguish symptoms from diseases and surface relevant active diseases  in a candidate problem list. 2. Validate the clinical phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for  10,000 patients The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create an automated, accurate, and robust clinical phenotyping engine to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value- based payment models. Project Narrative Individual and global care improvement demands accurate phenotypes. This type of clinical phenotyping is extremely challenging, requiring full clinical data and advanced semantic technologies to develop a longitudinal patient map. The approach, if successful, offers an opportunity to empower national efforts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.",Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare,9199039,R43LM012357,"['Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congresses', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'discrete data', 'empowered', 'experience', 'falls', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'payment', 'personalized care', 'population health', 'screening', 'success', 'support tools']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2016,222977,-0.001157723518413694
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,0.01893518582195415
"Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ‘bundled’ approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning. NARRATIVE This SBIR Phase 1 application seeks to create then use a dataset of predictor variables and outcomes from mechanically ventilated patients to develop novel analytical tools that predict whether individual ventilated patients will develop delirium, ventilator associated conditions, and pneumonia. This information will improve patient outcomes and facilitate clinical decision-making by nurses and physicians by drawing their attention and resources to the patients most likely to develop these conditions.",Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting,9254970,R43NR015721,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Work of Breathing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'forest', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'model design', 'model development', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NINR,"ORIGENT DATA SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2016,147653,0.03682509711073755
"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.",The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging,9146397,R01LM012355,"['Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypoglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Insulin', 'Internet', 'Linguistics', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Series', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'communication aid', 'critical period', 'design', 'ethnic diversity', 'frontier', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'literate', 'meetings', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'safety net', 'service utilization', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'uptake']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,628346,0.031255005017685
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9081248,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404000,0.003613189895884507
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.

"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,-0.018422650608899777
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9104120,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Health', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,253619,-0.009126945447231624
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9168282,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2016,217444,0.006383737804852569
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9120230,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2016,425000,0.026097744794410987
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9026622,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Housing', 'Imagery', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,257217,0.023397130816429274
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9144768,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2016,158304,0.034487368681246654
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",9325906,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,200000,0.033015785127733004

Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",9217714,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,150000,0.033015785127733004
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,9069491,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal outcome', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,654513,-0.0010589477332421649
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),9040788,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'randomized trial', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,458227,0.008448431796259741
"HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our research is focused on the use of advanced ontological models as a foundation for computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems that link hospitalized patient data routinely captured in electronic medical records (EMRs) with medical knowledge to effectively influence timely awareness and treatment choices by clinicians. Our phase 1 goal is to demonstrate how our advanced CDS technology has the potential to improve preventable mortality outcomes associated with sepsis in ICU patients. We distinguish two types of CDS algorithms available today for detecting and/or predicting sepsis using EMR data: 1) evidence-based ""knowledge-driven"" detection algorithms; and 2) data-driven ""predictive"" algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Recent studies indicate currently available CDS tools do not reduce risk of death in hospitalized patients. We believe this may be because diseases such as sepsis are time-sensitive, complex syndromes and also due to the challenges of computerized reuse of unstructured EMR data. Our sepsis ontology models this complexity to: a) provide enhanced knowledge-driven sepsis risk- stratified cohort classifications that help guide interventions; b) support accurate natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes to enhance real-time sepsis risk detection; and c) improve the accuracy of data- driven prediction models when used in conjunction with ML training algorithms. Our CDS is based on proprietary cluster computing technology we call ""VFusion"" designed to efficiently deal with the generation and practical use of large, application domain-specific ontologies. Our sepsis ontology employs a family of upper level ontologies, combined with granular evidence-based domain ontologies, configurable rule sets (e.g. first order logic-based), and required components of reference terminologies. Our research will use openly available ICU patient data to establish statistical detection/prediction performance metrics using this ontology in 2 modes of use: 1) as a knowledge-based screening tool to detect subtle signs of sepsis in individualized hospitalized patients; 2) used in conjunction with ML to improve data-driven predictive performance. We will measure specificity/sensitivity, and positive/negative predictive power of our hybrid ontology-based technology to demonstrate dramatically improved performance over existing CDS algorithms. In Phase II we plan a retrospective demonstration with a much larger sample of patients to include non-ICU patients in collaboration with a major healthcare system. Our product vision is an early inpatient sepsis detection algorithm with high accuracy embodied as a ""plug-in application"" compatible with any modern EMR platform in use at a client hospital effective in both ICU and non-ICU care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Even with the advent of powerful, new computer medical record technologies used in hospitals, the risk of death has not been reduced in hospitalized patients. The goal of this research effort is to combine medical record systems with advanced cognitive technologies that are commonly used today in products such as the iPhone ""Siri"" to improve clinician awareness and decisions that will dramatically reduce preventable mortality.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,8841749,R01GM097117,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Books', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fraud', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunosuppression', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'digital', 'dosage', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'response', 'success', 'thiopurine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,394118,0.022245493737101097
"Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals.  Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective.  One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis.  In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies - natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic - to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors / variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs, but may be more difficult for some patients than others. Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources, but it can be challenging to identify them in advance. In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost-effective.                ",Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,8902473,R41DK105612,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Failure', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'combinatorial', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional status', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIDDK,LP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,R41,2015,223336,-0.0003551024014294917
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8830936,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,494533,-0.028395311405140778
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,0.0439462804417743
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's.              n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),8840825,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,529458,0.008686876275319295
"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas. The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.",Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management,8914596,R01DK093832,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Area', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Intestines', 'Iron', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Medication Management', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'theories', 'vigilance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R01,2015,336757,0.01770352108489582
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8824963,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2015,461213,0.0192326495994517
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups. To address this challenge I propose developing methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available health professionals' expertise online for online health communities and help patients improve self-efficacy and self-care toward managing chronic disease.",InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities,8929297,K01LM011980,"['Address', 'Area', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Informatics', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social support', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'community setting', 'computer human interaction', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'user centered design']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2015,154413,-0.02238306477340226
"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care.

"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8789794,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,442019,0.003916479869259653
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8915740,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397940,0.003613189895884507
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,-0.01639465288118134
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.             ",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,8967301,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Engineering', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'State Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,159057,0.030677028889897626
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,-0.018422650608899777
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,0.026097744794410987
"Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): United States healthcare is embroiled in a crisis of inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost. Through two administrations, the national healthcare strategy has focused on using data and technology to control costs and improve care. Congress has enacted legislation to encourage measurement of quality, sharing of data, payment based on quality of care, and transparency within the healthcare system. While these goals are bipartisan and lofty, implementation requires both hard work from health systems and robust technology. Industry has developed technologies that incrementally further the national agenda, including electronic health records, computer assisted coding, and population health analytics. Each of these supports workflow within the healthcare system and improves profit margin for healthcare organizations. But, approaches that go beyond workflow, using data to better understand clinical care, are lacking. With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible. It will require advanced semantic technologies to understand clinical care strategies that have been tried in the past, but that have unknown efficacy. It will pose informatics challenges in inferring inclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes from incomplete and poorly structured data. It will require deep clinical understanding to run real-time pragmatic clinical trials based on real world data to understand complex patients. The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create the first commercial system to support healthcare in running real-time pragmatic clinical trials using full clinical data. This will augment the standard of care defined by randomized controlled trials to actually tailor therapy for those complex patients that account for the majority of healthcare spends, but for whom complexity precludes tailored randomized trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successful, the Phase I effort will represent a first step toward a revolutionary approach to leverage newly collected clinical data, rapidly evolving semantic technologies, and cutting edge clinical informatics to define best practices in healthcare. The overall project will target the complex patients that are poorly served by generalization of the randomized trial and currently account for the majority of healthcare spend. The goal is to leverage the national investment in clinical data to not just improve clinical workflow, but to actually transform medicine to achieve national goals of reducing costs and improving outcomes.            ",Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine,8979535,R43LM012168,"['Accounting', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Congresses', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'health data', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'meetings', 'payment', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2015,224712,0.011591445183877455
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8925840,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2015,158282,0.034487368681246654
"HopScore: An Electronic Outcomes-Based Emergency Triage System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this self-contained health information technology (IT) pilot is to refine and prospectively evaluate a novel, outcomes-based emergency department (ED) triage tool. The tool, HopScore' (developed at Johns Hopkins) aims to support objective triage decisions and improve patient differentiation based on time- sensitive and critical patient outcomes. HopScore uses easily obtained patient demographic and clinical information commonly collected at ED triage to predict patients risk for critical outcomes (i.e., i-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, emergent surgery or cardiac catheterization) and general inpatient admission. HopScore addresses deficiencies in the current standard, Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage tool used by 72% of EDs across the United States (US). Deficiencies of ESI include: (1) no link to critical patient outcomes, (2) a strong reliance on trige evaluator's subjective judgment which results in variable application, (3) poor distribution (i.e., discrimination) of patients across the 5-level index; almost half of all patients nationally are undifferentiated, classified as acuity level 3. At our urban and community ED study sites, the proportion level 3 is 57% and 64%, respectively.  Evidence from previous retrospective studies conducted by or team suggest that compared to ESI, HopScore will improve patient safety and drive more efficient distribution of limited ED resources. To evaluate these hypotheses, the specific aims of the application are to: (1) refine the HopScore decision tree algorithm for implementation using separate urban, community, and nationally representative ED populations, (2) design and develop HopScore as a software application that provides swift and interpretable triage decision-support, (3) execute a phased implementation toward consistent use in clinical practice at Johns Hopkins (urban) and Howard County General (community) EDs, (4) prospectively evaluate the HopScore application's usability and impact on patient and operational outcomes compared to ESI (i.e., pre- and post- intervention) in these same settings. The overarching goal of the proposed health IT project is to develop a usable triage tool implemented in clinical practice that has a positive impact on both patient and operational outcomes for a crowded inner-city and community ED. The Johns Hopkins ED provides care to a predominantly low income (64% uninsured or underinsured) and minority (71% African-American) population responsive to AHRQ's mission to support priority populations. Overall, the application is in-line with AHRQ's general IT portfolio goals to anticipate future needs and disseminate evidence on the effectiveness of health IT toward improving the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this health information technology (IT) pilot is to develop and evaluate a novel, outcomes- based emergency department (ED) triage tool (`HopScore').

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.                ",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,8836850,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Housing', 'Imagery', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2015,270727,0.023397130816429274
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8820077,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,250000,0.033015785127733004
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8887237,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,769163,-0.0010589477332421649
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care (PPINNC)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients on step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), yet our data show nurses do not quickly detect CRI onset nor seek help early 80% of the time even when individual VS monitors are alarming. We recently demonstrated that by using a complexity modeling-based algorithm we could improve detection of CRI. This proposal seeks to further apply complexity modeling-based algorithms to predict CRI prior to overt instability with sufficient lead-time and accuracy to support a nursing decision for preemptive therapy. Clinical decisional support systems (CDSS) continuously process complex data from disparate sources and apply predictive algorithms to alert clinicians early to impending events. One data-driven CDSS approach uses an artificial intelligence type called ""machine learning"" to evaluate moving-time series data and learn data patterns leading to an event. However, applying CDSS to predict CRI events has been limited by lack of suitably detailed datasets for learning support. We recently demonstrated that artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning of static VS data detected CRI up to 9.5 min before any continuously monitored VS alarmed. By applying machine learning to evaluate high-frequency VS data over longer moving time blocks and including demographic and clinical data a more sensitive and specific CRI prediction with longer lead-times will emerge. We propose to: 1) assemble a complex multidimensional dataset from our existing data sources to serve as the learning platform, 2) develop and validate machine-learned models for dynamic CRI prediction in SDU patients, and test which models are most effective relative to predictive ability, model parsimony and lead-time to event, and 3) use these findings to develop a prototype CRI prediction CDSS tool for nurses. Our demonstrated ability to assemble large high-frequency datasets with defined CRI events from which machine learning occurs makes our team (nursing, medicine, mathematics, computational biology, engineering, statistics) uniquely qualified to conduct this work. Study findings can foster a shift in CRI care from a reactive to preemptive nursing approach. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         Data from the proposed study will provide clinical decision support to permit nurses to predict cardiorespiratory instability prior to its overt expression in continuously but noninvasively monitored step-down unit (SDU) patients, and predict those patients who are likely to become unstable in the future. Such information will importantly permit nurses to shift instability care from a reactive to a preemptive approach, and impact patient safety and preventable mortality in SDU patients. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to predict which patients may become unstable also has important implications for improving nursing surveillance and care (frequency of monitoring, case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.                  ",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8641674,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2014,547410,-0.028395311405140778
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8652345,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2014,527741,0.0192326495994517
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment.             8.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8732711,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,435641,0.003916479869259653
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4                ",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8742367,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,419500,0.003613189895884507
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,-0.01639465288118134
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,0.026097744794410987
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp  This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for hearing aids, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based upon individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one's ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely results in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change the hearing aid sales and delivery models yet can also be implemented within existing business models by replacing contemporary hearing aid fitting methods (e.g. adjusting to gain-frequency targets followed by subjective fine tuning) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. Successful implementation of the ISPS technology will impact several barriers identified in RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting hearing aids and minimizing the need for highly skilled expertise), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs) and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to hearing aid fitting for patients who tend to avoid seeking professional help). This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility for the ISPS approach by (1) implementing the ISPS on a standard personal computer, (2) integrating the ISPS with a commercially available hearing aid, and (3) completing a pilot clinical study comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase II project will be proposed to enable extension of the technology to a wide range of hearing aids, patient characteristics and listening environments, including innovations supporting the use for remote and self-fitting applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel approach for fitting hearing aids using an individual's speech perception abilities. This automated approach can improved listener performance while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.                ",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp,8626066,R43DC013623,"['Achievement', 'Acoustics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R43,2014,149994,-0.0748837945115196
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.            ",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8805722,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2014,158241,0.034487368681246654
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)  Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.  Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8520023,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,250000,0.033015785127733004
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.            ",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8701182,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Infection of amniotic sac and membranes', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'public health relevance', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,786907,-0.0010589477332421649
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.            ",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),8669579,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2014,590279,0.008448431796259741
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care (PPINNC)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients on step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), yet our data show nurses do not quickly detect CRI onset nor seek help early 80% of the time even when individual VS monitors are alarming. We recently demonstrated that by using a complexity modeling-based algorithm we could improve detection of CRI. This proposal seeks to further apply complexity modeling-based algorithms to predict CRI prior to overt instability with sufficient lead-time and accuracy to support a nursing decision for preemptive therapy. Clinical decisional support systems (CDSS) continuously process complex data from disparate sources and apply predictive algorithms to alert clinicians early to impending events. One data-driven CDSS approach uses an artificial intelligence type called ""machine learning"" to evaluate moving-time series data and learn data patterns leading to an event. However, applying CDSS to predict CRI events has been limited by lack of suitably detailed datasets for learning support. We recently demonstrated that artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning of static VS data detected CRI up to 9.5 min before any continuously monitored VS alarmed. By applying machine learning to evaluate high-frequency VS data over longer moving time blocks and including demographic and clinical data a more sensitive and specific CRI prediction with longer lead-times will emerge. We propose to: 1) assemble a complex multidimensional dataset from our existing data sources to serve as the learning platform, 2) develop and validate machine-learned models for dynamic CRI prediction in SDU patients, and test which models are most effective relative to predictive ability, model parsimony and lead-time to event, and 3) use these findings to develop a prototype CRI prediction CDSS tool for nurses. Our demonstrated ability to assemble large high-frequency datasets with defined CRI events from which machine learning occurs makes our team (nursing, medicine, mathematics, computational biology, engineering, statistics) uniquely qualified to conduct this work. Study findings can foster a shift in CRI care from a reactive to preemptive nursing approach. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         Data from the proposed study will provide clinical decision support to permit nurses to predict cardiorespiratory instability prior to its overt expression in continuously but noninvasively monitored step-down unit (SDU) patients, and predict those patients who are likely to become unstable in the future. Such information will importantly permit nurses to shift instability care from a reactive to a preemptive approach, and impact patient safety and preventable mortality in SDU patients. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to predict which patients may become unstable also has important implications for improving nursing surveillance and care (frequency of monitoring, case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.

"Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to  explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index  patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio,8599828,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,568249,0.008088849745901022
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing No abstract available  Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and test methods of physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8421618,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2013,557031,0.0192326495994517
"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,-0.01639465288118134
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.

"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.            ",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8437066,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Infection of amniotic sac and membranes', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'public health relevance', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,774381,-0.0010589477332421649
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care (PPINNC)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients on step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), yet our data show nurses do not quickly detect CRI onset nor seek help early 80% of the time even when individual VS monitors are alarming. We recently demonstrated that by using a complexity modeling-based algorithm we could improve detection of CRI. This proposal seeks to further apply complexity modeling-based algorithms to predict CRI prior to overt instability with sufficient lead-time and accuracy to support a nursing decision for preemptive therapy. Clinical decisional support systems (CDSS) continuously process complex data from disparate sources and apply predictive algorithms to alert clinicians early to impending events. One data-driven CDSS approach uses an artificial intelligence type called ""machine learning"" to evaluate moving-time series data and learn data patterns leading to an event. However, applying CDSS to predict CRI events has been limited by lack of suitably detailed datasets for learning support. We recently demonstrated that artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning of static VS data detected CRI up to 9.5 min before any continuously monitored VS alarmed. By applying machine learning to evaluate high-frequency VS data over longer moving time blocks and including demographic and clinical data a more sensitive and specific CRI prediction with longer lead-times will emerge. We propose to: 1) assemble a complex multidimensional dataset from our existing data sources to serve as the learning platform, 2) develop and validate machine-learned models for dynamic CRI prediction in SDU patients, and test which models are most effective relative to predictive ability, model parsimony and lead-time to event, and 3) use these findings to develop a prototype CRI prediction CDSS tool for nurses. Our demonstrated ability to assemble large high-frequency datasets with defined CRI events from which machine learning occurs makes our team (nursing, medicine, mathematics, computational biology, engineering, statistics) uniquely qualified to conduct this work. Study findings can foster a shift in CRI care from a reactive to preemptive nursing approach. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Data from the proposed study will provide clinical decision support to permit nurses to predict cardiorespiratory instability prior to its overt expression in continuously but noninvasively monitored step-down unit (SDU) patients, and predict those patients who are likely to become unstable in the future. Such information will importantly permit nurses to shift instability care from a reactive to a preemptive approach, and impact patient safety and preventable mortality in SDU patients. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to predict which patients may become unstable also has important implications for improving nursing surveillance and care (frequency of monitoring, case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).                  Data from the proposed study will provide clinical decision support to permit nurses to predict cardiorespiratory instability prior to its overt expression in continuously but noninvasively monitored step-down unit (SDU) patients, and predict those patients who are likely to become unstable in the future.

"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States.

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this STTR project, we present EyeMark, a set of tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy using retinal image photographs. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in monitoring progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research. There is ample published evidence that MA turnover rates are a good predictor of likelihood of progression to more severe retinopathy, establishing MA turnover as an excellent biomarker for diabetic retinopathy. Measuring this quantity involves two steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual MAs. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done by entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the above limitations by automating both the steps involved in MA turnover measurement: accurate image registration, and MA detection. We will develop end-too-end desktop software for automated computation of MA turnover and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor diabetic retinopathy progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.              The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,8256763,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,330138,0.05226729123141964
"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation.  Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.              Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy. Also, the resulting predictive model will assist in clinical information system design to support clinicians' decision-making.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will use existing data to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to frail older community dwelling adults. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, nurse care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge also will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems.

"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)  Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.  Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8081750,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2012,150000,0.033015785127733004
"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.           The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.         ",Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma,8114413,R21CA152775,"['Address', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logic', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metastatic to', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'editorial', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'lymph nodes', 'melanoma', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,193798,-0.00733520131826165
"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.           Project Narrative A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all.

"Care coordination for older adults: Process, outcomes, cost    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research provides evidence that care coordination improves outcomes such as hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and reduces cost. One program using nurse care coordination as an intervention to improve care for community dwelling older adults' was Aging in Place (AIP) at the University of Missouri's Sinclair School of Nursing. AIP's service provider for the enhanced nurse care coordination intervention was Senior Care, a home health agency and Home and Community Based service provider. After the AIP study ended Senior Care continued to exist as a home health care (HHC) agency. Taking advantage of the unique data from the AIP study, and the HHC agency we propose to perform a secondary analysis to (1) identify care coordination interventions, intervention activities, and intervention doses used by AIP nurse care coordinators using enhanced nurse coordination, and HHC nurses providing traditional HHC , (2) describe any differences in interventions used by AIP nurse care coordinators, and HHC nurses, and finally (3) to identify whether outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost differ for older adults in the AIP and HHC groups. The original AIP analysis did not link specific nurse care coordination interventions with outcomes, identify the specific activities associated with interventions, explore intervention dose, or compare outcomes to traditional HHC. Data will compare two groups of older people who received services, those with enhanced nurse care coordination in the AIP group from the years 2000-2002 and those who received traditional HHC without enhanced nurse care coordination from the years 2003-2005. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods will be used to identify interventions and activities nurse care coordinators used when coordinating care for older adults. NLP transforms human-generated text into machine-readable (structured) information. We propose to use a unique iterative approach to NLP in which the available activities are extracted from existing electronic medical records from Senior Care, while new activities are identified by hand from records in which not enough information was found in the first pass. After each pass, a team of experts will check the extracted activities to assure that they are relevant to care coordination. Intervention profiles that are representative for AIP and HHC will be developed by determining what types of activities occur most frequently for each intervention category and target, and which ones are most representative of the category and target. Dose profiles of interventions will be developed, and finally, outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost will be compared between the AIP and HHC groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice. The Natural Language Processing method will add to our knowledge of how to successful use electronic medical record text data.              This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy. Also, the resulting predictive model will assist in clinical information system design to support clinicians' decision-making.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will use existing data to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to frail older community dwelling adults.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,-0.012004773799858252
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers.

"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits. Qualitatively, the project should make providing healthcare a more enjoyable experience for all involved, given the reduction of administrative time on the part of the highly skilled clinical staff.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities. Currently, creating that documentation requires a manual, and time-consuming process, which reduces the amount of time clinicians spend with patients, and increases the possibility of data errors. We propose to build a machine learning-based software system that can automatically generate the required clinical documentation, thereby saving time and reducing errors, which will improve the overall quality of patient care.              PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities.

"Predicting Patient Outcomes from Clinical and Genome-Wide Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Clinical classification and prediction are key components of clinical care. Even modest improvements in classification and predictive performance may have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This proposal describes a new, efficient Bayesian machine-learning method for performing clinical predictions. The method is designed to use both clinical and genome-wide data in predicting patient outcomes.       The method's performance will be evaluated using existing clinical and genome-wide data from the Framingham Heart Study that is being made available to qualified researchers through the SHARe resource of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The outcomes to be predicted in individuals include the onset of major cardiovascular events and death from all causes. The study will evaluate how well these predictions can be made with a new Bayesian method when using traditional clinical data alone, genome-wide data alone, and both types of data together. The method's performance will also be compared that of existing models and methods.       The main hypothesis to be tested is that the proposed machine-learning method will be an advancement over existing methods in that it will be computationally feasible to apply it using a combination of traditional clinical data and genome-wide data, and it will yield better predictive performance than do existing predictive models and methods. If shown to be so, this new method is anticipated to provide substantial benefit in future electronic patient-care systems, including applications to computer-based decision support that have available both traditional clinical data and genome-wide data.            Predicting whether an individual will acquire a disease is an important clinical task. This project will develop and evaluate a new computer-based method to predict diseases in individuals based on the use of both traditional clinical data and data about an individual's genetic make up.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.           Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.           Project Narrative A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives. In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process. The deliverable of Phase 2 will be version 3 of Pickcare to be released on-line for kidney transplantation and tested internally with recruited patients for dialysis. A manuscript describing how the system influences patient choice in kidney transplantation based on analysis of on-line user data will also be submitted for publication.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive. The tool is unique in that it is customized to patient conditions, it has high resolution to separate excellent, average and poor hospitals, it addresses patients' motivations to search for hospital information and builds trust by answering their questions independently of insurers or hospitals.           This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,-0.012004773799858252
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States.  More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas.  Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction.  Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom.  In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom.  Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn.  Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions.  (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment.  (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design.        This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus.  Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB.  Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by inter-hospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals.  In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug.  Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22.  Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site.  Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models.  Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model.  Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.           Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",7765514,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2010,400000,0.032013180216157566
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories. The intent is to expand the knowledge of and coordinate the services available to seniors and their families for improving their quality of life and for extending independent living.           My Health Care Manager Inc.

"Multi-institutional Consortium for CER in Diabetes Treatment and Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary /Abstract: The HMO Research Network's (HMORN) Diabetes Multi-Center Research Consortium (DMCRC) Coordinating Center proposes to build a national research network and a multi-system distributed database for conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) in the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus. The network is comprised of 31 investigators from 12 integrated healthcare delivery systems and academic institutions who study diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, childhood and adult obesity, weight management, medical informatics and biostatistics. The network has broad experience conducting system-based interventions to improve treatment of diabetes or to support lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes, as well as broad experience conducting CER. The 12-system database will capture and standardize detailed demographic and longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes and a much larger membership without diabetes. Once constructed, the database will be used to conduct and publish surveillance data on trends (2005- 2012) in the incidence, prevalence, treatment and outcomes of diabetes in this population. It will also be used to conduct two CER studies. The first is a cluster randomized, multi-system intervention that will rapidly identify diabetes patients with ""early nonadherence"" to newly prescribed anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. Early nonadherence refers to patient failure to fill either the first prescription of a new medication or the first refill, and has been shown to be more frequent than ""ongoing"" nonadherence. This information will be provided to population management outreach teams in 3-5 health systems via the EHR or other electronic database, along with training in counseling patients on adherence problems. Study outcomes of subsequent risk factor change and adherence to the new medication will be compared within each system to those for patients on teams that do not receive the new information. The second CER study is an observational evaluation of various communication, counseling and referral strategies as provided to women who have had an abnormal glucose test (fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) in the first 6 months after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and who are therefore at very high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Study outcomes include weight change over one year and self-reported physical activity four months after the abnormal test. In each study, we will collect process of care data by applying natural language processing (NLP) to clinical text in EHRs and survey patients for information on demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. These NLP-derived and patient-reported variables will be studied as possible mediators of treatment effectiveness or as potential modifiers of effectiveness (i.e. variables that identify patient subgroups that benefit less from usual interventions. Variables that prove to be important as mediators or modifiers may be good candidates for routine collection and incorporation into EHR's and/or future diabetes registries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus.

"Predicting Patient Outcomes from Clinical and Genome-Wide Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Clinical classification and prediction are key components of clinical care. Even modest improvements in classification and predictive performance may have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This proposal describes a new, efficient Bayesian machine-learning method for performing clinical predictions. The method is designed to use both clinical and genome-wide data in predicting patient outcomes.       The method's performance will be evaluated using existing clinical and genome-wide data from the Framingham Heart Study that is being made available to qualified researchers through the SHARe resource of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The outcomes to be predicted in individuals include the onset of major cardiovascular events and death from all causes. The study will evaluate how well these predictions can be made with a new Bayesian method when using traditional clinical data alone, genome-wide data alone, and both types of data together. The method's performance will also be compared that of existing models and methods.       The main hypothesis to be tested is that the proposed machine-learning method will be an advancement over existing methods in that it will be computationally feasible to apply it using a combination of traditional clinical data and genome-wide data, and it will yield better predictive performance than do existing predictive models and methods. If shown to be so, this new method is anticipated to provide substantial benefit in future electronic patient-care systems, including applications to computer-based decision support that have available both traditional clinical data and genome-wide data.            Predicting whether an individual will acquire a disease is an important clinical task. This project will develop and evaluate a new computer-based method to predict diseases in individuals based on the use of both traditional clinical data and data about an individual's genetic make up.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives. In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process. The deliverable of Phase 2 will be version 3 of Pickcare to be released on-line for kidney transplantation and tested internally with recruited patients for dialysis. A manuscript describing how the system influences patient choice in kidney transplantation based on analysis of on-line user data will also be submitted for publication.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive. The tool is unique in that it is customized to patient conditions, it has high resolution to separate excellent, average and poor hospitals, it addresses patients' motivations to search for hospital information and builds trust by answering their questions independently of insurers or hospitals.           This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"AMLETA: Automated Multi-Language Emergency Triage Assister    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During Phase I, we propose to develop an Automated Multi-Language Emergency Triage Assister (AMLETA), an internet-based, software prototype to assist triage nurses rapidly identify underlying symptoms of patients presenting to an emergency department to better prioritize those patients when they are unable to speak English. AMLETA will be designed for use by patients who are conscious, which typically represents over 95% of patients arriving to the emergency department (Levels 2-5 of the Emergency Severity Index - see below), and are physically able to interact with a computer system. The system will quickly elicit the most critical information about a patient's condition and then summarize those findings, in real time, to the triage nurse who can then prioritize patients based on his/her training and the resources available within the department at the time. Although many emergency departments have live interpreters to help communicate with patients who cannot speak English, those interpreters may not be available immediately to assist as soon as a patient arrives in the emergency department. In areas of the country where multiple languages are spoken, the hospital may not have interpreter in all needed languages. The ability to quickly understand the patient's chief complaint and prioritize care is the objective of triaging in the emergency department. Having a tool to assist in identifying the patient's presenting symptoms in any language can have a major beneficial impact on the delivery of care, particularly in overcrowded hospitals serving diverse populations, and during times of disasters. During Phase I, we will explore the challenges of creating a decision tree to quickly identify critical information necessary for prioritizing patients. Because our system is intended to be used by patients in a foreign language, designing an intuitive interface with graphical elements and audio narratives to accommodate potential low reading and health literacy will be a challenge.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,-0.012004773799858252
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Diagnosing a patient's condition and predicting the patient's outcomes are critical activities in clinical care. The better these activities can be performed, the better the patient's healthcare results are likely to be. Similarly, efficient use of healthcare resources depends upon being able to determine accurately when and where a resource is likely to be useful, which also involves making predictions. Even modest improvements in predictive accuracy can at times have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Thus, for both individual patients and for society at large, making accurate healthcare predictions is an important task.      There is a clear trend toward having more and more patient data that is available electronically in healthcare information systems and in databases of clinical research studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to construct evidence-based predictive models from these data sources. Indeed, numerous clinical prediction models have already been constructed. Typically, a single prediction model has been induced from the data, and then applied -- as relevant -- to each future patient. Such a population-wide model is constructed to try to optimize its average predictive performance on all future patient cases to which it is applied. Model induction does not take advantage of information about the patient case at hand, which could potentially enhance the form and content of the model that is constructed.      The current project will investigate methods that construct patient-specific models that are sensitive to information about the patient at hand. These new methods will be evaluated for their performance in predicting patient outcomes in the diverse domains of sepsis, heart failure and substance use disorders. A variety of current population-wide model-construction methods, including logistic regression and neural networks, will serve as controls.      If patient-specific models can improve upon the predictive performance of population-wide models, as seems plausible, the added performance is likely to provide substantial benefit as a component of future computer-based decision-support systems for clinical care. n/a",Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data,7185137,R01LM008374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Societies', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,278631,0.00608891815959007

"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients supported on * DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm.

"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model.

"Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Foot ulceration is a diabetic complication that results in over $1 billion worth of medical expenses per year in the United States alone. To better quantify the external forces involved in ulceration, researchers are developing new hardware systems that can measure both shear stress and vertical pressure. As these systems are commercialized, visualization software will be required for display and analysis of the 3-D stresses acting on the plantar surface. The proposed research will develop an advanced foot pressure and shear data visualization system, based on the innovative use of a deformed 2-D wire mesh to indicate stress, combined with more traditional vertical elevations and color-coding to indicate pressure. This new software will be adaptable to a variety of measurement systems, and will allow a clinician to see an accurate, 3-D representation of the maximum pressure and shear locations on the plantar surface. Also, novel analysis algorithms will be developed to identify areas where skin pressure and stress patterns (e.g., bunching, shearing, or stretching) are most likely to cause pathological consequences. Availability of this advanced software, in combination with new pressure/shear hardware measurement systems, will greatly improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: According to the American Diabetes Association, there are approximately 16 million patients in the United States with diabetes, with 800,000 new diagnoses each year.  For these patients, foot complications account for more hospitalizations than any other clinical problem, and plantar ulcerations are a major reason for subsequent foot amputation.   The proposed research will lead to a new commercial software product aimed primarily at the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.   In addition, product applications can be extended to the estimated 1 million patients per year who develop pressure ulcer bedsores, as well as to prosthetic limb patients who are at risk of skin breakdown due to peripheral vascular disease. n/a",Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System,6443499,R43DK061164,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomechanics', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decubitus ulcer', ' foot', ' mechanical pressure', ' mechanical stress', ' monitoring device']",NIDDK,"FOSTER-MILLER, INC.",R43,2002,119415,0.005490370747547511

"COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING Encouraging physicians to counsel their smoking patients to quit is a national health priority. Physicians note several barriers to counseling smokers, including a lack of time, expertise, and organizational support. Using computers for collecting data to assist physicians in counseling patients is a way of improving the utilization of current computer technologies and behavioral models. Despite the efficacy of computer systems that enhance prevention, many barriers remain to the incorporation of such programs outside of research settings. Such a health communications system can assist a busy physician as it can query smokers about their habit, organize and present the information to provide ""best practice"" guidance for intervention and follow-up. The specific aim of this study is to determine, through systematic formative research, how to best integrate an innovative computer ""expert system"" into everyday used in primary care offices. In this formative (NCI-phase II) pilot study we propose to carry out focus group discussions with all parties directly involved in primary care practices (patients, physicians, staff) to understand how best to integrate the system into everyday practice. We will integrate the computer expert system in the practices of five primary care physicians. Our primary hypothesis is that the system will be able to be integrated into primary care practice and be used by more than 50% of smokers before their physician visit. Our secondary hypothesis is that the computer system will increase the number of smoking cessation counseling activities undertaken by physicians (e.g., set a quit date), measured by patient exit interviews. Armed with the data from the pilot study, our future aim will be to: a) further refine the computer expert system into an optimal package for integration into practice and b) to conduct a randomized clinical trial (NCI phase III) of the system in a more representative sample of physicians with sufficient power to evaluate the initial efficacy of the intervention using verified 7 day point prevalence and continuous abstinence as the primary outcomes.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING,6175236,R03CA083346,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' patient care management', ' primary care physician', ' smoking cessation', ' technology /technique development']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R03,2000,76181,-0.07974667901130462
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,-0.011135504249482297
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,0.0038839399175565766
"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Adoption', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Canada', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fibrosis', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Midwestern United States', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Trichrome stain', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Trust', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'functional improvement', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pathology imaging', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'renal damage', 'shared database', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,-0.0007583375586468188
"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10066805,F32HL151181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Inequality', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'claudication', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,82476,0.01618648054625849
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data.

"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,9992378,F31LM013403,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Ethnography', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policy Maker', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Service provision', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'court', 'deep learning', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'social', 'social bias', 'social inequality', 'symposium', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,50520,-0.00020066929809026176

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,4.893279648394504e-05
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,-0.0026189074637993043
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,9991534,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.008103398862407683
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the Affordable Care Act-mandated Hospital Readmission Reduction Program launched in 2012 has modestly reduced readmissions, an unintended consequence has been the shift of a significant fraction of heart failure (HF)-related care to the outpatient setting.

"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis.

"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death. Despite being underrecognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with projected large increases in its prevalence worldwide. The overall goal of this grant is to use advanced, state-of-the art biomedical informatics and big data methods to generate a tool using electronic health record data to detect patients with sarcopenia early and facilitate patient recruitment, engagement and clinical interventions to treat sarcopenia.",Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes.,9970930,R01AR077273,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Birth', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Exercise', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand Strength', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'age group', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical center', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'performance tests', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'portability', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research clinical testing', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIAMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,235788,-0.0031520744426493017
"Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 54% of doctors are experiencing burnout and the primary cause is documentation. Doctors spend up to two hours on clerical work for each hour of direct patient care. Documentation burden is the number one contributor to burnout, which costs the US health care system approximately $150 billion each year. Further, the largely free-text notes generated by healthcare providers are difficult to process and re-use for quality improvement and research. There is a significant opportunity to A) reduce clinicians' clerical burden via ambient data collection while B) enabling incorporation of machine learning into routine clinical care by structuring information in real-time from the patient-doctor conversation. We have built a service that saves each clinician hours per day by using remote human scribes, who we make more efficient with machine learning and natural language processing, to automatically document patient visits. The service runs on a laptop or mobile device and converts patient-clinician conversation audio to structured documentation. Our approach has already enabled the service to be priced at half the cost of a traditional in- person scribe. Finalized notes can be saved into all common electronic health record (EHR) systems via the Redox interoperability interface. We will use the human-curated audio-to-structured documentation dataset to further improve preprocessing, automating more of the scribing process, and reducing human effort over time. A time motion study and EHR click log analysis in a clinical setting demonstrated time savings of up to two hours per clinician per day. We have successfully generated documentation for over 1,700 patient visits and our dataset will double in size in 2 months. In Phase I, we address key impediments in the structure and timeliness of current EHR data, both of which can be improved with our novel system when coupled with the real-time generation of machine learning-ready inputs. In order to do so, we propose three aims: 1) extract machine learning-ready inputs from patient-doctor conversation audio; 2) extract machine learning-ready inputs from structured and unstructured EHR data; 3) further increase cost-efficiency and scale up the quality assurance process using machine learning inputs from conversation audio and historical EHR data. For Phase II we will apply our machine learning inputs to predict disease trajectory for multiple disease phenotypes with a focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These diseases are ideal proofs-of- concept due to their high prevalence, morbidity, and inclusion in incentive programs for closing care gaps. The $6.3B in 2018 Medicare Advantage incentives supports a clear business case for leveraging machine learning to achieve value-based goals – improving patient care quality and efficiency.! PROJECT NARRATIVE PredictionHealth has built a service to reduce doctor burnout by automatically documenting patient visits by processing audio from the normal patient-doctor conversation - potentially reducing the $150 billion dollar cost of burnout on the US health system. We propose that integrating and facilitating the application of machine learning in routine clinical care can improve patient care outcomes and efficiency. The primary goal of this Phase I proposal is to further improve the service's cost-efficiency with real-time machine learning predictions based on structured inputs from the patient-doctor conversation and prepare to integrate machine learning as an integral element of each doctor's toolbox.",Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership,10009209,R43LM013215,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cost efficiency', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time and Motion Studies', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'direct patient care', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'laptop', 'novel', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment planning']",NLM,PREDICTION HEALTH INC.,R43,2020,222130,0.009427702270147277
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,0.010991538147604368
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'data fusion', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,0.007158215312333734
"Automated acute pulmonary embolism detection and staging from CT Project Summary / Abstract Minnesota HealthSolutions (MHS) proposes a Phase I project to develop and validate a software product capable of automatically detecting and staging pulmonary embolisms (PEs) using clinically routine pulmonary CT angiograms (CTAs). The proposed system will combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods and the clinical expertise of MEDNAX Radiology into a system that integrates seamlessly into the Radiology workflow and standard patient care path to improve the treatment decisions of physicians in the emergency department. Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death in hospital patients with an estimated incidence of 1 per 1,000 patients. CTAs are routinely used to detect PE today; however, there is significant variability in the detection rate among radiologists using CTA. Furthermore, despite the strong evidence that the RV/LV ratio is an important clinical biomarker it is rarely measured quantitatively in practice. A successful completion of this project would provide a workflow-integrated tool capable of faster PE detection and more accurate staging of right heart strain to guide the physician’s treatment decision.

"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,10001603,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,654816,-0.012494588031340553
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death.

"Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects adults of all ages yet can present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure. Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE. In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a 20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets (analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner. Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism, disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3 Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3 PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.",Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood,10081921,R43HL154941,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyspnea', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myoglobin', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Troponin I', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Venous system', 'Vermont', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'instrumentation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient safety', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,BIOCOGNIV INC.,R43,2020,299749,0.001168528153752132
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10015336,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Pressure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morality', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Rewards', 'Right to Treatments', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prospective', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,235205,0.014441921096328912
"Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis modality for solute and volume control. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high (~75%) but kidney recovery occurs in up to two-thirds of survivors. Fluid overload is a potentially modifiable risk factor associated with these outcomes. However, there are currently no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. Due to recent advances in computer science and widespread big data usage, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach. DL allows construction of risk prediction models using time-series data that incorporate thousands of variables and dynamic changes in these variables derived from multi-dimensional sources and not only static values of these variables. We propose to develop and validate innovative DL approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes using multi-modal data from electronic health records and CRRT machines. We demonstrated superiority of DL models without a-priori variable selection compared to optimized logistic regression (C-Statistic of 0.72 vs. 0.62) for prediction of RRT liberation. We also showed that mortality prediction improved by incorporating changes in clinical data within 6-hour intervals after CRRT initiation. In addition, we identified distinctive mortality risk according to quintiles of achieved net ultrafiltration rates, after adjustment by patient’s weight, duration of CRRT, and other clinical parameters: OR 8.0 (95% CI: 2.7-25.1) when the highest quintile (>36 ml/kg/day) was compared to the lowest quintile (<13 ml/kg/day). We hypothesize that innovative DL approaches integrating time- series data will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction models that can impact CRRT delivery. We will utilize a multi-institutional dataset that encompasses clinical data and CRRT programmatic and therapy data (CRRTnet registry, n=1500 patients) for model development and an independent multi-institutional dataset for validation (n=1500 patients) to: 1) continuously predict short-term (7-day) and medium-term (28-day) liberation from RRT due to kidney recovery; 2) continuously predict 24-hour mortality; and 3) identify and validate sub- phenotypes of patients with AKI on CRRT with differing achieved net ultrafiltration rates. This innovative research will assist 1) the development of novel clinical decision support platforms for guiding informed CRRT delivery and promoting kidney recovery; 2) the identification of sub-phenotypes of patients that can benefit from precision- medicine approaches to fluid removal during CRRT; and 3) the design of interventional studies focusing on fluid removal during CRRT to impact patient-centered outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and hemodynamic instability, yet mortality is high (~75%). Presently, there are no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. We propose to develop and validate innovative deep learning approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes, which could guide CRRT decision-making including intensification, de-escalation, and enrich clinical trials focusing on fluid removal during CRRT.",Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy,10261059,R56DK126930,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fluid overload', 'Goals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kidney', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'solute', 'therapy design', 'time use']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R56,2020,100000,0.0068478559731082285
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes).

We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome.",A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods,10007806,R21DK122229,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Update', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized management', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repository', 'risk benefit ratio', 'transplant centers', 'transplantation medicine']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,191618,-1.0871889724194423e-05
"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10083570,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2020,549149,0.01761096489545416
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records Sepsis, Septic Shock, and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) are among the top causes of hospital mortality, morbidity, and an increase in duration and cost of hospitalization. Successful prevention and management of these conditions rely on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent these events. Acute care settings and in particular intensive care units (ICUs) provide an environment where an immense amount of data is acquired, and it is expected that with the advent of wearables and biometric patches even more data will be available in such settings. But at present, very little of these data are used effectively to prognosticate, and the existing predictive analytics risk scores suffer from lack of generalizability across institutions and performance degradation within the same institution over time. The PIs on this proposal recently demonstrated that a Deep Learning-based algorithm can reliably predict new sepsis cases in the emergency departments, general hospital wards, and ICUs by as much as 4-6 hours in advance and an area under the curve (ROC) of 0.85-0.90. Furthermore, through a 2-year pilot study funded via Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we recently joined forces in a multicenter academic consortium to retrospectively validate this algorithm at each site. Our collaboration has resulted in a multi-center longitudinal EHR dataset of critically ill patients and has generated several important questions and findings related to design of portable and generalizable predictive analytics algorithms that are robust to problems arising from gaps, errors, and biases in electronic health records (EHRs) due to workflow-related factors (e.g. staffing-level), and heterogeneity of patient populations and measurement devices. We propose to continue our prior work by designing new deep learning architectures that are more robust to data missingness and biases introduced through the variability in process of care, 2) development of new learning methodologies to improve generalizability of the proposed models under data/population drifts (aka distributional changes), 3) enhanced metadata design to assist in quantifying ‘conditions for use’ of such algorithms via algorithmic controls, and 4) HL7 and FHIR-based prospective implementation and testing of these methodologies to provide real-world evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Ultimately, these novel methodologies and tools will enhance our ability to use EHR and other types of continuously measured longitudinal data to predict adverse events, assess patients’ response to therapy, and optimize and personalize care at the beside. The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in hospitals. We want to develop methods that work across different demographics groups and hospital settings to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for life- threatening conditions such as Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the hospitals.","Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records",10265157,R56LM013517,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acute care', 'aging population', 'authority', 'base', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'response', 'septic patients', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'ward']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,393958,0.023276843368688075
"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,9992419,F31HD102159,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Fetal health', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Infant', 'Israel', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal Health', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'falls', 'feedforward neural network', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'multidimensional data', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized health care', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tailored health care', 'theories', 'tool', 'unborn child', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2020,39120,0.003423052339090674
"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patient’s SUD risk level.",SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care,9897003,R43DA050218,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Assessment tool', 'Blinded', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'reduced substance use', 'referral services', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2020,229810,0.024769205023299365
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination. Narrative About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. care.coach is developing a care platform that provides 24x7 proactive patient support to mitigate falls and delirium in a scalable, cost-effective manner.","A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk",9829116,R44NR017842,"['Adverse event', 'Advocate', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Country', 'Delirium', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Feeds', 'Felis catus', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Nursing Staff', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Jamaica', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Maine', 'Medical center', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'School Nursing', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Team Nursing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Washington', 'Work', 'acute care', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'dementia care', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional decline', 'hospital bed', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient engagement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'social', 'speech synthesis', 'technology development', 'treatment as usual', 'virtual']",NINR,CARE.COACH CORPORATION,R44,2020,555611,0.027766901457444794
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs in order to reduce patients' suffering and improve quality of life.",Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,10004708,K23HL143181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'American', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical center', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital services', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'physical symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'skills', 'study population', 'supportive environment', 'unstructured data', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,173628,0.06663963733756086
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Assisted living communities- transforming predictive data into proactive care for COVID-19 ABSTRACT Recent data suggests that that older Americans who contact COVID-19 are at greatest risk for hospitalization and poor outcomes. Additionally, due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for developing COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Since the identification of first US case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, several outbreaks have been identified in long-term care and assisted living facilities with evidence of rapid spread. Older residents and the staff of long-term care assisted living facilities as well as public health officials are facing a multitude of challenges which render early detection of COVID-19 infections difficult in these facilities and which have posed a major barrier to the efforts to control the spread of infection. Adding to these challenges, more than half of residents with positive COVID-19 test results are asymptomatic at the time of testing, further contributing to transmission. There is an urgent unmet need for strategies for monitoring of residents in long-term care and assisted living facilities to facilitate early detection of the infection using means that require minimal person-to-person contact. While the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread is being addressed by several contact tracing apps, assessing the risk for development of severe symptoms and hospitalization in these community residents requires active physiological monitoring and ecological momentary assessment in the context of preexisting clinical conditions and presents an immediate unmet need. With this project, we propose to deliver a user- friendly COVID-19 early detection alert platform (COVID-Alert) that integrates: 1) biosensor ensemble that noninvasively and continuously monitor and record critical vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and activity level); 2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the 5-question set released by CDC and adopted across US by healthcare providers and health insurance industry; 3) artificial intelligence framework that triggers an alert based on synthesis of real-time physiological biosensing data feed, EMA monitoring of symptoms, with personalized risk profiles of preexisting conditions derived from electronic health record maintained by the facility. COVID-19 clinical decision support integrated into the workflow of long-term care facilities will ensure that residents receive appropriate and timely care (resident level) and ongoing surveillance to prevent an outbreak (facility level) while avoiding unnecessary staff exposure. This study brings together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in engineering, informatics, data science, machine learning, and CDS. The advanced data-driven predictive model will be trained and validated using both high-dimensional EHR data and clinician feedback. The process of the algorithm development and clinical implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through formative and summative evaluation. NARRATIVE Due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization from COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying.

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,0.027836215354605807
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9989634,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,38064,-0.013648960037993041
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9971553,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2020,119199,-0.016790415117711253
"Aligning Patient Acuity with Intensity of Care after Surgery ABSTRACT A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate with the training and resources necessary to develop expertise and experience in large-scale, multi-institutional informatics research using electronic health record data and machine learning to develop clinical decision-support tools. This proposal builds toward the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist with expertise in design and implementation of machine learning systems to augment clinical decision-making. To accomplish this goal, the candidate and mentors propose a systematic investigation of postoperative ‘patient acuity’ (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and ‘intensity of care’ (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory measurements). After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity and intensity of care can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use, affecting approximately 15 million inpatient surgeries annually in the US alone. When high-acuity patients receive low-intensity care, postoperative complications can progress to critical illness and cardiac arrest. Providing high-intensity care to low-acuity patients has low value and may cause harm through unnecessary treatments. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying ‘intensity of care’ definition. The overall objective of this application is to understand intensity of care decision spaces in surgical patients and match them to clinical phenotypes and outcomes, leveraging this knowledge to generate precise, autonomous decision-support tools. The central hypothesis of this application is that inappropriate postoperative intensity of care is common, predictable, and associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, morbidity, and hospital costs. The rationale for this work is that integrating electronic health record data, machine learning, and clinical domain expertise offers opportunities to understand postoperative intensity of care decisions and develop decision-support tools capable of optimizing clinical outcomes and resource use. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) develop and validate postoperative intensity of care definitions, (2) develop and validate interpretable, actionable acuity assessments that elucidate decision spaces, and (3) identify and predict postoperative intensity of care phenotypes. The proposed research is significant because it addresses a problem that affects millions of patients annually and is associated with potentially preventable harm and suboptimal resource use. The approach is innovative because the candidate and mentors are unaware of any prior attempts to classify and adjudicate postoperative intensity of care and understand the phenotypes and characteristics of patients receiving insufficient or excessive care. During the award period, the candidate will apply for an NIH-R01 investigator-initiated award for the prospective clinical implementation of an interpretable, actionable decision support tool incorporating validated intensity of care definitions and knowledge garnered from phenotype clustering, initially in a silent data collection period followed by a live period during which clinicians are provided with model outputs and clinically actionable recommendations. NARRATIVE After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and intensity of care (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory test monitoring) can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use.

"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,9871727,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2020,157896,-0.002565890158449165
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10023939,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,245156,0.02092010598802235
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10212519,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2020,833315,0.02606663925134008
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9967226,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2020,249000,0.05149289810338981
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once.

"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy. In this proposal we will develop an analytic framework for predicting patient life-expectancy allowing for the personalized study and and ultimately treatment of individuals with ESKD.",Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD,10050938,R01DK123062,"['Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hemodialysis', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Provider', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Update', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'survival prediction', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,745259,0.028563907278714204
"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.04968277306322319
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.0067350758106722915
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,0.02145897191963607
"Modernizing Emergency Department Nurse Triage via Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Emergency department (ED) nurses triage over 136 million patients each year in the United States. The goal of triage is to assess and identify clinical conditions in order to prioritize those with the most significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Current practice uses the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score to group patients by resource utilization. ESI has significant limitations including: racial bias, poor relation to patient-centered outcomes, subjectivity, and failure to differentiate acute patients (poor specificity). As such, the ESI tool fails to identify patient-specific factors, that are present at the time of triage, to accurately predict critical conditions requiring life-saving treatments. Due to its time sensitivity, complex symptomology, variable outcomes, and a national cost burden of $21 billion, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) will be used as an exemplar time-sensitive condition to develop a new predictive machine learning algorithm to be used for ED triage. Of 800,000 new annual ACS cases in the United States, nurses fail to identify approximately 50% during triage. This suggests an urgent need to develop triage tools, specifically ones that correctly identify ACS early, which could potentially reduce mortality by 10%-20%. This project proposes to use big data analytics to address the critical gaps of the ESI tool and nurse failure to identify ACS at triage. A large cohort of patients presenting to 17 different EDs with symptoms suspicious of ACS will be used to create a multidimensional database, extracting routinely collected patient factors from the electronic health record data acquired at initial nurse triage. This project will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches that incorporate the complex interactions between patient factors to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that require time dependent treatment. The innovation of this study stems from having access to a world renowned academic medical center that is able to conduct full-scale studies using electronic health records of over 4.2 million patient encounters. This project aligns with the NINR’s strategic vision for nurses to use emerging technologies (big data) to predict patient trajectories, inform interventions and support real time clinical decision making. By using advanced machine learning concepts, we will translate our final machine model into a robust clinical tool to assist nurses in making real time clinical decisions to accurately identity ACS events and initiate timely treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. Study findings have potential to change the paradigm of ED nurse triage to be more objective and data-driven, thereby recognizing critical conditions at initial triage and eliminating unnecessary morbidity and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emergency department nurses triage over 136 million patients a year, using the Emergency Severity Index score that has significant limitations and often fails to identify patients with critical time-sensitive conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) approximately 50% of the time. To address these gaps, this project aims to develop a predictive algorithm using state-of-the-art machine learning concepts that incorporates the complex interactions between medical data available at nurse triage in order to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that requires time dependent treatment.

"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients,10216732,R01DK118222,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coca', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consultations', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health system', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nephrology', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteinuria', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'podocyte', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'proteomic signature', 'renal damage', 'response', 'sample collection', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'virology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,468762,0.0120079561747458
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,0.005739104434456296
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9930157,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,644350,-0.009107884029945333
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9970170,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,991540,0.004057307023411911
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10019727,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,502902,-0.026440240993444213
"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,9882377,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,475350,-0.07355922319193234
"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG. This project seeks to demonstrate the benefit of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), a quantitative and objective angle assessment method, and develop anterior segment OCT-based methods for the clinical evaluation of patients with PACD.",Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease,9852450,K23EY029763,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Aqueous Humor', 'Area', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epidemiology', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gonioscopy', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lasers', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma', 'Primary Health Care', 'Pupil', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractive Errors', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Trabecular meshwork structure', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Width', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'standardized care', 'targeted treatment']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2020,228758,-0.0014660230221949285
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9999034,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data streams', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,205524,-0.010429907287340404
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,0.011438538354296366
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9928348,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,126700,-0.0005344719370114189
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10071621,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,770947,-0.034293029981398965
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,0.013886547562137365
"Operationalizing Machine Learning and Discrete Event Simulation Models to Improve Clinic Efficiency PROJECT SUMMARY Physicians often report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Systematic data-driven methods for efficiently scheduling patients are important as physicians are pressured to see more and more patients. We propose that real time prediction models of patient visit lengths, the likelihood of missing appointments, and of patient wait times will help schedule patients more efficiently. Clinics will be able to safely overbook to avoid empty slots from missed appointments, have guidance for scheduling urgent add-on patients, and provide wait time estimates for patients when there are delays. We will develop methodologies for accessing data needed for these predictions in real time and propose that the integration of these models into workflows will improve scheduling accuracy, patient wait time, and patient satisfaction, while also increasing clinic volumes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physicians report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Machine learning and discrete event simulation model predictions can help schedule patients more efficiently, but need to be integrated into the EHR and scheduling workflows to be effective.

"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,0.017319917934919916
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators. The proposed research aims to create quality measures that can be deployed across rheumatology practices to improve the quality of care, while training new researchers to perform innovative patient-oriented research in the area of electronic health record-based quality and outcomes measurement.",Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology,9873905,K24AR074534,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning progression', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,189666,0.011040827024826816
"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10117905,R01HS027417,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,392599,-0.005917225617454788
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status. Project Narrative World Health Organization has reported that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).

"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,0.02220416543215114
"A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the importance of advance care planning (ACP) for older patients who are most at risk of dying, and a critical need exists to optimize this process. ACP empowers patients to express their values and goals for care before they become too ill to do so. ACP also prepares patients, and their families, to make difficult decisions in real time when the moment arises. For older patients, COVID-19 may result in respiratory failure and high mortality rates. However, many older patients may prefer to avoid these interventions, especially if the mortality rate is high and death is experienced alone in the hospital without family nearby. Motivated by the disproportionate risk to older patients from COVID-19 and the higher mortality rates, primary care clinicians should engage all older patients with ACP to ensure their preferences are known and honored. Unfortunately, many clinicians have not been trained in ACP and patients are unfamiliar with it.  To address this gap, we have developed a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for COVID-19 that implements ACP routinely into medical care and responds to the present need for virtual communication. The ACP Program combines two well-tested, evidence-based, and complementary interventions: online clinician communication skills training and ACP patient video decision aids. The overall objective of this application is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 and its consequences for an aging US population that may prefer to forgo aggressive potentially ineffective interventions, and to die outside of the hospital setting. To accomplish this, we propose to conduct a Pre-Post trial using an open cohort design of a telehealth ACP Program among older patients in the nation's COVID-19 epicenter, New York. We will train 250 primary care clinicians caring for 25,000 diverse patients over the age of 65 from the largest health care system in New York (Northwell Health). We will use Natural Language Processing to abstract our outcomes from the electronic health records for patients. We hypothesize that a telehealth ACP Program of clinician serious illness communication skills training combined with ACP videos will improve and sustain rates of ACP from the time that the intervention is implemented compared to the time prior to the intervention.  Clinician communication training and video decision support is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach to uniformly provide robust ACP. Major strengths of this proposal are: the highly experienced team making this project feasible; the present infrastructure already embedded at Northwell Health, which has the largest number of COVID-19 patients in the US; and, the potential immediate deployment of the intervention, if successful, across the country. This work holds the promise of improving the quality of care provided to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically shown the need for advance care planning (ACP) by older patients who are most at risk of dying, and there is a critical need to optimize this process. Communication skills training for clinicians and patient-facing video decision aids have shown promising efficacy for improving patient-clinician communication, increasing ACP documentation, and leading to more patient-centered care. This proposal seeks to assess the effectiveness of a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for increasing documented ACP conversations, improving clarification of resuscitation preferences', and enhancing palliative care and hospice utilization in 25,000 patients at Northwell Health, the largest health care system in New York and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.",A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City,10170786,UH3AG060626,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Resuscitation', 'Resuscitation Orders', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'acute care', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient health information', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,UH3,2020,2405961,0.0019104046295737981
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,9866226,R01DK123459,"['Address', 'Biological Markers', 'CCL2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Renal function', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'United States', 'aptamer', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'complement pathway', 'complement system', 'diabetic', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nephrogenesis', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'stem', 'study population', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'urinary']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2020,498936,-0.0038739305319515295
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,-0.00936811594456333
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of our parent project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. Its first two aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. For this supplement, we plan to focus on COVID-19. The emergence of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and its corresponding disease, COVID-19, has led to about 100,000 deaths in the US and great economic loss and human suffering. Carrying out randomized clinical trials to assess treatment is essential but stymied by the difficulty recruiting sufficient patients and the urgency of the question. Clinical databases are beginning to fill with COVID-19 patients, but the acuity and severity of the disease make drawing causal conclusion much more difficult, resulting in a literature filled with conflicting observational studies. We propose to employ structural causal modeling in the study of COVID-19, engaging expertise in such modeling. We will use the Columbia University Irving Medical Center's clinical data warehouse with over 6000 testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) network, which includes most COVID-19 patients in Korea, Spain, the US Veterans Administration, Stanford, Tufts, and new sites coming on board. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 has had a giant impact on society and understanding the risks and finding effective treatments is essential. This project develops and tests methods to better elucidate those risks and treatments.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,10175300,R01LM006910,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Assimilations', 'COVID-19', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Korea', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spain', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'effective therapy', 'health data', 'improved', 'network informatics', 'parent project', 'recruit']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,37243,0.012598778126834832
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9869048,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,595773,0.03416622127545858
"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,-0.022240538890856077
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators. CARING will improve nursing care quality and make direct, positive impacts on patients, their families, and caregivers.",SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance ,10018103,R01LM013323,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nurse Administrator', 'Nurses', 'Nurses Performance Evaluations', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute care', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'health care quality', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'massive open online courses', 'multimodality', 'nursing care quality', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,239104,0.038233712399050525
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9980981,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2020,15376,0.00904794746859577
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,-0.0002252769254040713
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,-0.0011060683162312135
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9930430,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,384234,0.0030704281369307537
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,0.03287013426834282
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9908166,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model', 'statistical learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,172680,-0.008142047720075183
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9931317,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,81000,-0.009453548561708458
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,9946956,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,439224,0.002544554836306435
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9864083,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,611937,-0.014214787222323683
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,9870519,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2020,120966,0.019003179353164108
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,-0.0510318376789971
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9982399,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,792540,0.011678042570028607
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9994364,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'diverse data', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,746610,0.021429846506566198
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,9886675,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,669305,0.001903460288768216
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,-0.005350210118765078
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10006784,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'data fusion', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,1627982,0.017339483065984616
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,0.026217274263158966
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,393957,-0.005660180301514176
"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,81571,-0.00034948474095347637
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,650000,0.02967632011936943
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,0.044538537313642004
"Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The number of people with primary open angle glaucoma is expected to exceed 100 million by 2040. The first-line therapy for glaucoma treatment is patient-administered hypotensive medication delivered topically via an eye drop. However, studies have consistently shown that patients rarely adhere to dosing recommendations. According to the Wilmer Glaucoma Center of Excellence, nearly 50% of individuals discontinue eye drops within six months of their first prescription. Of those that persist beyond six months, only 37% continue the therapy after three years, and only 10% of those prescribed glaucoma drops are persistent (without gaps) over the first year. Failure to adhere to dosing recommendations dramatically limits the effectiveness of eye drops in lowering intraocular pressure and delaying or preventing the progression of glaucoma. This well-known problem has prompted the development of several technological solutions for tracking adherence. Retinal Care's proposed solution is fundamentally different. The proposed device is a simple and inexpensive combination of sensors designed to provide feedback to patients, providers, payers, and care coordinators regarding the way a patient interacts with their medication. Tactile and motion data is acquired through a custom force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and a standard three-axis accelerometer. Combined, these two data sources provide significant insight into drop adherence, application mechanics, and patient behavior. More importantly, this data can inform decisions on how and when to intervene with a patient to maximize the likelihood of continued long-term drop adherence and vision preservation. The primary innovations are in the single-use design (enabled by low-cost custom FSR fabrication and the unique combination of low-cost electrical components), the novel mining of motion and tactile information for patient adherence and behavioral data, and the integration with an existing care coordination framework. Retinal Care approaches health care more holistically than traditional companies; recognizing the behavioral and psychosocial factors that are a root cause of blindness from eye diseases like glaucoma. While Retinal Care employs cutting-edge technology such as deep learning and advanced medical devices, we work actively toward implementing technology in a way that translates directly to improved quality of life for our patients by managing the entire care path. The technology proposed here, while novel in design, is not intended primarily as a tracking tool, though it will accomplish that sub-goal with greater effectiveness and at less cost than any existing product. Instead, it is designed explicitly to reduce blindness by providing the crucial data needed to tailor our interaction and intervention strategies to the individual patient; to maximize patient engagement and adherence to glaucoma care through a combination of education, incentivization, tailored communications, and personal interaction with our trained care coordinators. The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility (cost and functionality) of the simple device that will enable Retinal Care to effectively reduce blindness and visual impairment from glaucoma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally and in the US, where it affects more than 3 million Americans and costs the US economy $2.86 billion every year in direct costs and productivity losses. Topical medication administered through eye drops is a common and effective first-line therapy for reducing intraocular pressure and controlling glaucoma, but patient adherence to dosing recommendations is a consistent and pervasive issue that contributes significantly to vision loss. Retinal Care Inc. intends to develop and deploy a suite of simple, disposable, bottle-integrated sensors that will continuously collect real-time adherence and behavioral data to inform the design of patient-specific intervention and incentivization strategies to improve adherence and reduce blindness from glaucoma.","Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement",10010396,R41EY031632,"['Accelerometer', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Direct Costs', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nylons', 'Ophthalmology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plant Roots', 'Polyurethanes', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Retina', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'care coordination', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'incentive strategies', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2020,219896,0.0418955289782618
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9987573,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'social culture', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,372633,0.0402865537513929
"Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors program (SyMon-SAYS) for children with cancer in decreasing patients’ symptom burden, decreasing parent-perceived barriers in managing their child’s symptoms, increasing patients’ and parents’ self-efficacy and increasing patients’ quality of life.

"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,-0.00033363072790591774
"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,-0.0030436363553718927
"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9912121,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2020,493891,0.009133862088204143

The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.007527804580623341
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9936306,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2020,146065,0.03555731573256517
"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9971443,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,515814,0.024729373224187078
"In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to uncertainty regarding the most efficacious combinations of interventions. As patients are connected within healthcare facilities by the movement of healthcare workers (HCWs) and mobile equipment, evaluation of an intervention's impact on transmission and infection must consider these network dynamics. Additionally, each institution has its own staffing ratios, equipment management, and cleaning practices that inform the efficacy of an intervention. To address knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies at an individual hospital, we will build a model framework that will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with MDROs using clinically relevant information collected during the normal course of care combined with operational data on staffing and equipment movement; (2) to utilize hospital- level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a framework for other hospitals and healthcare systems to examine the effectiveness of interventions parameterized by their own institution's data. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic health records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. Data on patient-connectedness will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Finally, a generalizable framework will be constructed and tested across a network of healthcare facilities. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients' risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital,10110718,U01CK000589,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2020,550000,0.002990057506052898
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,9946617,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,2331112,-0.006362001139894672
"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,0.01039149734762248
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models.

"Center for Clinical and Translational Science The COVID-19 global emergency raises many difficult patient care and healthcare management questions. Which drugs are the most viable candidates for a given patient? How can we efficiently and effectively assemble the right cohort for a trial? What social determinants impact course and outcome? How can we rapidly deploy clinical decision support tools when new knowledge is available every day? The N3C is a partnership across the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, distributed clinical data networks (PCORnet, OHDSI, ACT/i2b2, TriNetX), and other partner organizations. The N3C aims to improve the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with COVID-19 clinical data, expand our ability to analyze and understand COVID, and demonstrate a novel approach for collaborative pandemic data sharing. Under this proposal we will contribute electronic health record data on patients afflicted with COVID-19 and appropriate control patients.

"Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record Project Summary / Abstract Annually, approximately 8 million people are discharged from an acute care hospital to a post-acute care facility, accounting for >20% of all hospital discharges and >40% of all Medicare discharges. Post-acute care facilities frequently provide rehabilitation services for patients experiencing functional limitations after acute illness who cannot return home safely. Clinicians in acute care hospitals often fail to recognize hospital- acquired functional limitations until after resolution of acute medical/surgical issues. This failure delays hospital discharge and the start of rehabilitation in a post-acute care facility, which can exacerbate hospital-associated functional limitations. Patients' mobility status, one component of physical function, is an important factor in determining the requirement for a post-acute care facility. Simple, validated tools for routinely evaluating patient mobility are increasingly common in acute hospitals but are not routinely used to predict the need for discharge to a post-acute care facility. One such tool, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), is a validated and reliable mobility measure for patients in acute care hospitals. The AM-PAC IMSF is used, as part of routine clinical care throughout hospitalization, for all patients in our acute care hospital. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that lower AM-PAC IMSF scores at hospital admission were strongly associated with post-acute care facility placement. Our goal is to expand upon our preliminary work to develop a formal model to predict which patients are likely to require post- acute care facility placement. Such prediction would be invaluable for improving the discharge planning process and expediting receipt of rehabilitation services at a post-acute care facility. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that prediction models, leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records, can help optimize the hospital discharge process. Thus, we propose the following Aims: 1) To determine if baseline patient mobility status, measured by the AM-PAC IMSF within 48 hours of hospital admission, is predictive of hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care; and 2) To develop a dynamic prediction model, using both the hospital admission AM-PAC IMSF score and the subsequent trajectory of daily scores after hospital admission, to predict hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care. This proposed research addresses the AHRQ priority of improved efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery via improving the hospital discharge process, with associated improvement in patient outcomes. Project Narrative We propose to use a validated and reliable mobility score, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), collected as part of routine clinical care, to develop static and dynamic prediction models, using classification trees (a machine learning method), that will help with early identification of patients needing discharge to a post-acute care facility. Earlier identification of patients likely needing post- acute care facility services during acute care hospitalization can reduce costly delays in discharge which, in turn, exacerbate patients' hospital-associated functional losses and disability. Leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records and the data-driven prediction models via this proposal can fundamentally improve current acute care hospital discharge coordination and planning, along with improving patients' functional outcomes.",Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record,10056338,R03HS027011,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,99860,0.05385143217887917
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,-0.002916215992011009
"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry. Lastly, the proprietary mobile health technology can be used for the treatment of other type of wounds and diseases such as burns, acute wounds, battle wounds, and endoscopic diseases.",Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction,10081799,R44AG067799,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Burn injury', 'Chronic Care', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Information Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stasis Ulcer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Visit', 'Visual Perception', 'Wound models', 'acute wound', 'augmented intelligence', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'care coordination', 'checkup examination', 'chronic ulcer', 'chronic wound', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data management', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'dimensional analysis', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'healing', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 designs', 'programs', 'routine care', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIA,"XYKEN, LLC",R44,2020,298277,0.031264950308656704
"IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) Although healthcare costs in the United States rank among the highest in the world, critical health outcomes rank lower than other high resource countries. In an effort to improve healthcare quality and concomitantly reduce costs, Congress identified certain serious and expensive but preventable hospital acquired conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcer injuries (PUI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI), that would no longer be reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These preventable adverse events have been linked with nursing time with patients. Nurses play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes by quickly identifying patients at risk, evaluating the extent of these risks, and acting upon the changing status of the patient, a process termed “nurse surveillance.” Hence, nurses are key contributors to overall patient surveillance and safety. The Joint Commission recommends that the nurses give report at the patient bedside, termed “bedside shift report” (BSR), to reduce errors and improve continuity of care; hourly rounds (HR) are also recommended to reduce falls; both of these measures contribute to nurse surveillance of patients, but their relationship to patient outcomes remains understudied. NewYork-Presbyterian, a large academic health system, is piloting an innovative technology called “iN,” to improve BSR and HR through the use of color-changing lights and integrated mobile app to remind nurses when these activities have not been completed. This technology uses a combination of mounted hardware in the patient room with obfuscated computer vision to provide constant surveillance of the patient room and companion software supplied via a mobile phone app that integrates these technologies. This novel intervention to increase BSR and HR by nurses, which generates detailed process data, offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain a complete understanding of all activities that take place at the bedside and yet has not yet been studied to characterize nurse surveillance or to assess associations with related patient outcomes. The IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) study will characterize nurse surveillance and its influence on patient falls, HAI, and PUI to generate new knowledge about factors that influence these nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Using the dataset built in this study that will integrate data from the iN device, electronic health record, staffing and census data, and hospital reported quality measures on falls, HAI and PUIs, this prospective cohort study design will use descriptive statistics and a Cox-proportional hazard model to characterize nurse surveillance and the contribution of BSR and HR to nurse surveillance to generate predictive indicators of these nurse-sensitive outcomes (falls, PUIs HAIs), which can be used to identify intervention targets. The IMPORTANT study addresses AHRQ’s specific priorities to conduct “Research to improve health care patient safety,” and “Harness data and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes and to provide a 360-degree view of the patient” and will address AHRQ priority populations of the those with multiple chronic conditions, minorities, and women. Project Narrative This “IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT)” study will explore an innovative technology that will capture information about a technology-enabled intervention to improve nurse surveillance and subsequent nurse-sensitive patient outcomes: patient falls, pressure ulcer injury, and hospital acquired infections. This study will provide an enhanced understanding of nursing interactions with patients at the bedside and subsequent effects on related patient outcomes through the use of both existing data and novel technology.",IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT),9979041,R03HS027006,[' '],AHRQ,HUNTER COLLEGE,R03,2020,44853,0.02219201335730145
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9975704,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,435018,0.02685665574555349
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9938607,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'family burden', 'genetic testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,638566,0.0009417309231064858
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9886260,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,143581,0.001991945261461464
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Secure Homomorphically Encrypted National Registry of COVID-19 Recovered Plasma Donors PROJECT SUMMARY Treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) was recently approved by the FDA for seriously ill patients of COVID-19. There are many institutions and hospitals that have implemented CP programs, but they all face the challenge of finding sufficient and appropriate donors. The constraints of matching, imbalances in supply and demand, and privacy concerns pose several challenges to engage donors. Considering multiple stakeholders (patients, donors, hospitals), we will develop new algorithms based on multikey homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of patients and donors, with additional functionality to simplify the registration process, and conduct optimization for plasma donation (of patients who recovered from COVID-19). We are dedicated to the public good and will make freely available the code / resources developed within the framework of this project. If we succeed, our project will build a secure national registry for potential plasma donors and may save many lives. Narrative We are proposing a novel platform for convalescent plasma donation with integrated privacy protection and resource optimization. The goal is to remove the barriers and concerns for COVID-19 recovered patients to donate their plasma to save severely ill patients.

"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",10019319,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,561565,0.022458038089634605
"Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments,9977422,K01DK121866,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Anti-Cholinergics', 'Benign', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Botox', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nocturia', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Residual volume', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Human Experimentation', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urinary Retention', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urodynamics', 'Urology', 'Woman', 'alpha Toxin', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mathematical model', 'micturition urgency', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,22825,0.035677358407739494

"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,0.008000218889742854
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,-0.00883937923803612
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,-0.014492128886615982

also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research
