"Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and bipolar disorders (BD) are remarkably common, with SZ alone affecting nearly three million Americans. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist for these conditions and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that, in addition to highly penetrant rare mutations, NPD risk also reflects the impact of hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting these genetic variants (the vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes. To understand how these myriad risk loci causally contribute to disease risk, it is essential to screen for putatively causal variant(s) and determine how they influence gene expression, which has been shown to be cell-type specific, as well as cellular function. Recent evidence has emerged indicating a substantial contribution of RNA splicing variation to heritability across many complex genetic diseases, including SZ. Based on our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that a substantial proportion of NPD GWAS loci exert their pathogenic effects on neuronal function by impacting RNA: its structure, modifications, protein interactions and splicing. To test this, we will apply novel tools and machine learning methods to predict and quantify RNA splicing in the largest SZ, ASD and BD GWAS, in order to predict splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs, Aim 1). To confirm true effects on exon inclusion independently in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (i.e., the major cell-types impacted in NPD), up to several thousand of the predicted splice variants will be tested by a massively parallel reporter assay, MaPSy (Aim 2). Finally, in order to evaluate the cell-type-specific impact of putative causal sQTLs identified in Aims 1 and 2 on neuronal maturation and synaptic function, we will use CRISPR gene editing to engineer these mutations within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of both neural cell types (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to map and functionally evaluate the NPD-GWAS loci that impact alternative splicing and neuronal function. Our work may impact the field by delivering new insights into the role of common variants in NPD pathophysiology, which could inform ways of improving diagnostics, predicting clinical trajectories, and developing novel therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The causal role of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants putatively involved in RNA splicing on neuronal function has not been fully explored. By combining genetic fine-mapping, machine learning methods, massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR-genetic engineering, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models, we propose to discover neuropsychiatric risk alleles predicted to impact alternative splicing and empirically test their molecular and functional impact in neurons. By better understanding the role of common variants in disease risk, we hope to improve diagnostics, predict clinical trajectories and develop novel therapeutic interventions.",Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation,10415485,R56MH127844,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'FURIN gene', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Introns', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'overexpression', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'standard care', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell model', 'synaptic function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R56,2021,772112
"Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation To be fully understood, the human genome must be considered in the context of evolution. The activities that have dominated human genomics for three decades — such as genome sequencing and annotation, interrogation with high-throughput biochemical assays, and the identification of associations between genetic variants and diseases — have been enormously informative, but these descriptive studies must eventually be understood within the theoretical framework of evolutionary genetics. We must continue to press forward from the what? to the why? and how? of human genetics.  The goal of my laboratory is to interpret high-throughput genomic data from an evolutionary perspective. Drawing from ideas and techniques in molecular evolution, population genetics, statistics, and computer science, we aim both to understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genomes, and to use evolution to shed light on the phenotypic importance of particular sequences. Our recent activities have focused in three major areas: (1)  reconstruction  of  features  of  human  evolution  based  on  genome  sequences;  (2)  prediction  of  the  fitness consequences  of  human  mutations;  and  (3)  the  study  of  transcriptional  regulation  and  its  evolution  in primates.   We have reported major findings in each of these areas, including the existence of gene flow from early modern humans to Eastern Neandertals, a map of fitness consequences for mutations across the human genome, and an analysis showing that the architecture of transcription initiation is highly similar at enhancers and promoters in the human genome.  Here we propose to extend our research substantially in each of these areas, working together with a broad range  of  experimental  and  theoretical  collaborators.    Our  new  goals  include  the  development  of  improved methods for reconstructing human demography, with a focus on ancient gene flow; extensions of our ancestral recombination graph (ARG) sampling methods to accommodate much larger samples sizes, with applications in association mapping and the detection of natural selection; two complementary machine-learning approaches for  improving  the  prediction  of  fitness  consequences  from  sequence  data;  an  experimental  collaboration  to leverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens in characterizing noncoding mutations; a multi-pronged study of the sequence determinants of RNA stability and their implications for the evolution of transcription units; and development of a new probabilistic model for turnover of regulatory elements.  Together, these projects will address a wide variety of fundamental questions about the function and evolution of sequences in the human genome. Vast quantities of genomic data are now available to describe patterns of genetic variation within  human populations and across species, and various measures of biochemical activity along the human  genome. These data need to be interpreted in light of the fundamental forces of mutation,  recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift that have shaped genetic variation. This  proposal describes a series of projects that make use of new computational, statistical, and  theoretical methods to address fundamental questions in human evolutionary genetics, including how  humans arose   from our archaic hominin and ape cousins, how human populations diverged from one  another, how new mutations influence human health and fitness, and how regulatory sequences  contribute to unique aspects of human biology.","Evolutionary Human Genomics: Demography, Natural Selection, and Transcriptional Regulation",10107826,R35GM127070,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'RNA Stability', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'computer science', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'statistics']",NIGMS,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R35,2021,479215
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non-coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well-described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome-wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE’s utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 100,000 CREs and 375,000 variants, representing ~100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element’s regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 20 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,10241056,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2021,1496338
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,10172932,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,325001
"Deep tensor genomic imputation Project Summary/Abstract High-throughput sequencing assays allow scientists to measure biochemical properties like transcription factor binding, histone modiﬁcations, and gene expression in nearly any cell line or primary tissue (“biosample”). Unfortunately, measuring all possible biochemical properties in every biosample is infeasible, both because of limited sample availability and because the cost would be prohibitive. We have previously developed a state-of- the-art imputation method, called Avocado, that can ﬁll in the holes in such data sets. Avocado couples tensor factorization with a deep neural network. The method is scalable to large data sets and provides more accurate imputations than competing methods such as ChromImpute or PREDICTD. We have already applied Avocado systematically to the NIH ENCODE data set and made the imputations publicly available via the ENCODE web por tal.  Here, we propose to extend Avocado in four important ways. First, we will extend Avocado to handle single-cell data sets, thereby effectively turning each single-cell experiment into an in silico co-assay that measures multiple properties of each cell in parallel. Second, we will extend Avocado to work with data such as Hi-C, which measures three-dimensional properties of DNA. The extension involves converting Avocado's 3D tensor (biosample assay  genomic position) to a 4D tensor with two genomic position axes. This extension will apply to a wide variety of data types, including various types of Hi-C data, SPRITE, GAM, ChIA-PET and PLAC-seq. Third, we will enhance Avocado to use variant aware genomic sequence to enable high-resolution imputation of regulatory proﬁles. Finally, we will leverage the imputed data to infer cis-regulatory sequence annotations and the molecular impact of regulatory non-coding variants in one of the most comprehensive collections of cellular contexts.  All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and latent factorizations will be made publicly available via the web portals associated with the NIH 4D Nucleome and ENCODE Consortia, providing a valuable public resource for users of these data sets. Project narrative High-throughput sequencing can be used to measure many types of biochemical activity along the genome in a huge variety of primary cell types and cell lines (“biosamples”), but it is prohibitively expensive to measure all possible types of activity in all possible biosamples. Accordingly, we have developed a powerful machine learning approach to predict such measurements before they are performed. Here, we propose to increase Avocado's utility by extending the method to work with single-cell data types, to work with 3D genome architecture data, to incorporate information about DNA sequence and to decode regulatory DNA sequence and non-coding genetic variation.",Deep tensor genomic imputation,10096947,R01HG011466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Avocado', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'cost', 'data standards', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in silico', 'large datasets', 'next generation', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'syntax', 'transcription factor', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,398567
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,10115126,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,605699
"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mammalian genome', 'novel', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'scaffold', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell therapy']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased. This project will provide that high-resolution view.",Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes,10078275,R01GM125722,"['Antibodies', 'Bar Codes', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-protein crosslink', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'billboard', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'crosslink', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'organizational structure', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'syntax', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,453058

New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",10241049,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guide RNA', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,742538
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,10369167,R00AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R00,2021,249000
"Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Myosins are a diverse and ubiquitous class of molecular motors that are responsible for generating much of the macroscopic force in the human body. The human genome encodes 38 different isoforms of myosin, and members of this group act as force sensors or generators for a diverse set of processes throughout the body. To serve this wide array of functions, each myosin isoform has been biophysically tuned for its physiological role. In fact, the tuning is so precise that missense variants in one myosin isoform, !-cardiac myosin, can cause a congenital cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in people under 30. And yet, it is unknown how particular variants cause disease, or how to infer the pathogenic potential for novel mutations.  Large differences in functional properties between myosin isoforms are not the result of large differences in coding sequence or overall topology. Neither foreknowledge of phylogeny nor crystal structure is sufﬁcient to predict an isoform's biophysical properties. Furthermore, mutations causing disease frequently occur in regions of the protein far from the site of their deleterious effects. Poor understanding of the biophysical regulation of motor function has hampered the development of pharmaceuticals and the interpretation of human genomic data.  My goal is to establish a mechanistic understanding of myosin motors that is capable of predicting if and how sequence variation changes biophysical properties and can cause cardiac disease. Since myosin kinetics are not apparent from sequence or overall structure, they must be determined by other factors. I hypothesize that kinetic differences result from differences in the allosteric networks in these proteins. Allosteric network in this context refers to the coordinated conformational ﬂuctuations that give protein regulation the appearance of action at a distance. To test this hypothesis, we will use our unique combination of enormous computational power for molecular simulation and cutting-edge machine learning tools for analyzing protein allostery.  Aim 1 is to identify the biophysical determinants of myosin isoforms' differing speeds. To test our hypothesis that allosteric networks are responsible for modulating dynamics, I will use molecular simulations of different myosin isoforms and compare their allosteric networks with biochemical data about their properties. Aim 1 directly addresses outstanding questions about normal molecular-biological function of the heart, putting it in line with NHLBI overarching objective #1.  Aim 2 is to determine the difference, at atomic resolution, between healthy and diseased !-cardiac myosin. I hypothesize that the pathogenicity of variants with an unknown molecular etiology is a consequence of allosteric disruption, and will use our computational tools to test this hypothesis by simulating a set of known-pathogenic variants. This aim uses techniques from data science to understand the genetic determinants of health, and will apply equally well to rare alleles in under-represented groups as to majority groups. It is directly addresses NHLBI overarching objectives #3, #4, and #7. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Myosins are a closely-related group of molecules that are responsible for generating much of the force in the human body, including the heartbeat, the movement of limbs, and driving food through the stomach and intestines. Small changes to the myosin genes can have large effects: in healthy people, these give rise to different myosins that perform different functions, and mutations in some myosin genes can give rise to diseases that cause of sudden cardiac death. This proposal aims to learn, at the level of atoms and interatomic bonds, why and how these subtle changes to the myosin gene can create such large effects in the protein's function.",Physics-based precision medicine: computationally phenotyping myosin isoforms and cardiomyopathy mutations,10087552,F30HL146052,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Appearance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cardiac Myosins', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital cardiomyopathy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Etiology', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Intestines', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Speed', 'Stomach', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Variant', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'computerized tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'force sensor', 'genomic data', 'heart function', 'improved', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'member', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'rat Ran 2 protein', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,50520
"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,10128484,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'detection method', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'variant detection']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,38173
"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Enhancers', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'blind', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'programs']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,10112245,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312660
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,10208923,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,332892
"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carrying Capacities', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene Delivery', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic approach', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Variant', 'adeno-associated viral vector', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'cell type', 'computational suite', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'human disease', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'intein', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'success', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871
"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,10179320,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612601
"1/2 Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population. We will then apply these analytical methods to the psychENCODE data corpus, integrating these data with GTEx, ENCODE, and CommonMind data, annotating GWAS SNPs associated with psych disease, prioritizing the discovered regulatory elements for validation, and visualizing all psychENCODE data in an integrated fashion. We will then validate these predicted regulatory elements using large-scale genomic assays in neuroblastoma cells, iPSC cells, and neuronal precursor cells differentiated into neuronal lineages, and using a microfluidics platform capable of culturing neuronal cells and neuronal organoids. The results from these studies will further our understanding of the genetic regulatory basis for neuronal function in both normal and neuropsychiatric disease states.

"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,10192732,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,448294
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells PROJECT SUMMARY Many non-Mendelian (polygenic) human genetic diseases involve multiple causal loci in noncoding regions of the genome, implicating mutations in regulatory elements rather than protein-coding genes as the cause of these diseases. Deciphering the etiology of these human genetic diseases requires an understanding of how genes are regulated during development and homeostasis to produce functional cell states. This regulation is encoded both through epigenetic chromatin state, and genetically encoded in the DNA sequence of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators. However, these regulatory elements and their activity states in human cells are not resolvable with current technologies. As aberrant gene regulation likely underlies many human diseases, understanding (1) the function of regulatory DNA elements and (2) their activity dynamics during healthy human development are essential. To address these two problems, I propose to: (i) develop new experimental methods to profile multimodal chromatin state in single cells; (ii) identify alterations in regulatory element activation states that guide cell fate choice during human hematopoiesis; (iii) identify the DNA sequence features important for regulatory element function; (iv) build community tools and resources for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Together these aims will provide methods and resources for the interrogation of the human functional genome, and the identification of regulatory state dynamics that generate human cell types. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional training supported by co-mentors Dr. Rahul Satija (single-cell biology), Dr. Vijay Sankaran (hematopoiesis), Dr. Danny Reinberg (gene regulation), and Dr. David Knowles (machine learning). I have developed a 5-year career development plan that integrates scientific training in hematopoiesis and gene regulation, practical training and mentorship in deep learning, extensive leadership training through courses and mentorship, and seminars and workshops on academic writing. My team of scientific mentors will provide further guidance and mentorship in academic job searches. The New York Genome Center is an ideal environment for research and further career development, providing the cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment.

"A novel human T-cell platform to define biological effects of genome editing PROJECT SUMMARY Genome editing technologies have extraordinary potential as new genomic medicines that address underlying genetic causes of human disease; however, it remains challenging to predict their long-term safety, because we do not know the consequences of potential side effects of genome editing such as off-target mutations or immunogenicity. Our long-term goal is to understand and predict such unintended biological effects to advance the development of safe and effective therapies. T-cells are an ideal cellular model because: 1) they are highly relevant as the most widely used cells for development of therapeutic genome editing strategies (such as cell-based treatments for HIV and cancer) and 2) mature T-cells encode a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that can be exploited as built-in cellular barcodes for quantifying clonal expansion or depletion in response to specific treatments. We, therefore, propose the following specific aims: 1) to predict which unintended editing sites have biological effects on human T-cells by integrating large-scale genome-wide activity and epigenomic profiles with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 2) to develop a human primary T-cell platform to detect functional effects of genome editing by measuring clonal representation, off-target mutation frequencies, immunogenicity, or gene expression. If successful, our experimental and predictive framework will profoundly increase confidence in the safety of the next generation of promising genome editing therapies.

"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods. This proposal introduces a series of algorithmic and software innovations that will empower SV discovery, genotyping, and interpretation in large-scale human disease studies.",Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes,10153847,R01HG010757,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Clip', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Family Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Paint', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'dosage', 'exome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,692048
"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2021,111394
"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns. Understanding the intronic codes that confer sensitivity to these naturally occurring genetic changes will provide insight into the mechanisms of spliceosome function as well as the biological pathways distorted by spliceosome dysfunction that may present new therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states,10183903,R01GM141544,"['3&apos', ' Splice Site', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Auxins', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Data', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Helicase', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spliced Genes', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'gene expression variation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'helicase', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patched protein', 'recombinase', 'recombinase-mediated cassette exchange', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,323400
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204
"High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in nearly one percent of live births each year and are the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality. The majority of genetic studies in CHD have focused on variation within the protein-coding exome; however, most disease-risk loci fall in noncoding regions, and it is presumed that some of these represent important regulators of gene expression such as cis-acting enhancers and insulators. In spite of these studies, less than half of the heritability of CHD has been explained via genome-wide associations or burden testing of protein-coding genes and putative regulatory elements. In this proposal, we hypothesize that genetic variants that alter 3D genome folding contribute to the etiology of CHD by disrupting the contacts of key cis-regulatory mechanisms in development. One type of chromatin structure that could be affected is the Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), which refers to a level of chromatin organization characterized by higher contact frequency within the domain relative to loci outside of that domain. It has been shown that while unaffected controls show a clear depletion of SVs at TAD boundary regions across the genome, individuals diagnosed with Developmental Delay (DD) and autism showed no bias in the genomic location of SVs. Based on these findings and the high rates of co-morbidity between DD and CHD, the first aim characterizes structural variation at TAD boundaries and other non-coding regulatory regions in CHD relative to controls, and will further determine whether TADs are enriched for SVs in a region-specific manner based on proximity to genes active in the developing heart. In the second aim, we use a complementary annotation- agnostic deep learning approach developed in our group to predict chromatin contact changes as a result of genetic variants in CHD patients. We will use Hi-C sequencing to confirm the model-predicted chromatin contact effects in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and additionally use RNA sequencing to determine whether the hypothesized transcriptional disruption occurred. Finally, in the third aim we will create a model that uses genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of genetic variants found in each individual to predict their phenotypic status. By analyzing the relative importance of features used to make predictions, we will be able to determine what types of biological mechanisms and pathways are most predictive for congenital heart anomalies. Collectively, these findings will elucidate a currently underappreciated source of regulatory disruption in human development, identify new disease-relevant genes and potential therapeutic targets, and will refine and validate a method for the high-throughput prediction of chromatin contact frequency to advance the field of 3D genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality, congenital heart defects have been studied extensively to better understand their underlying genetic mechanisms. However, previous approaches have focused on direct mutations to protein-coding elements and were not sufficient to explain the full heritability of this disease. Our proposal posits that an underappreciated disease mechanism is transcriptional misregulation during development caused by variants that disrupt 3D genome organization, and we therefore aim to characterize the extent to which this occurs in human heart defects and validate specific examples.",High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies,10138298,F31HL156439,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fetal Heart', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'congenital anomaly', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2021,37830
"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual. We aim to utilize a computational method to identify such elements in the genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,10189652,R35GM130376,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,523665
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",10075940,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,395000
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10251159,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,439299
