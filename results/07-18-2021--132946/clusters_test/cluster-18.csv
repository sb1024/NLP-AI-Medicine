"Improved Surgical Navigation Using Video-CT Registration Abstract  In many surgical procedures, image guided surgery (IGS), also known as surgical navigation, facilitates precise surgical manipulations near critical structures such as the brain and eye. IGS suffers from critical limitations such as loss of precision and correspondence with preoperative imaging once surgery begins and the anatomy is altered. These limitations may be addressed through intra-operative imaging, which effectively “resets” the model and thus enables both improved precision of IGS as well as improved surgical decision- making. However, intraoperative radiologic imaging has many limitations, including disruption of the workflow, cost, and additional radiation exposure. This project aims to develop solutions to resolve limitations of IGS without the need for intra-operative radiologic imaging. Our solutions rely upon data from a device that is present in every procedure using IGS, namely, the endoscope. Our goal in this project is use endoscopic video images to reconstruct surgical anatomy as it changes. This enables sustained precision in registration with pre- operative imaging throughout the procedure by updating the anatomical model as surgery progresses. We will achieve this by 1) using advances in computer vision to develop improved methods for continuous direct registration between the endoscope and the CT; and 2) developing methods that continuously compute the geometry of observed surfaces and update the preoperative CT with changes in that geometry. The technology developed in this proposal thus enables the following: 1) precise surgical navigation using the endoscope throughout the procedure; 2) surgical decision-making without the need for additional intra-operative imaging; and 3) new tools to reconstruct surgical anatomy and quantitatively evaluate the extent of surgery. Narrative  Image guided surgery is widely used to safely navigate around complex structures like the ethmoid bone and critical structures such as the brain; its utility is greatly enhanced when coupled with intraoperative radiographic imaging because the anatomic changes caused by surgery are clearly elucidated and can be incorporated into the surgical plan. This project will develop computational methods that exploit readily available endoscopic video to improve the accuracy of navigation and to provide intraoperative updates to the anatomic model. This technology will enhance surgical decisions in the operating room and enable precise navigation throughout the surgery without the need for additional radiologic imaging in the operating room.",Improved Surgical Navigation Using Video-CT Registration,10099301,R01EB030511,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Documentation', 'Endoscopes', 'Ethmoid bone structure', 'Eye', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Investigation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Radiation exposure', 'Safety', 'Sinus', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Touch sensation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'operation', 'radiological imaging', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628311
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR . NARRATIVE More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease. While the CDC conventional standard two-tier approach for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,10171859,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,381543
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,10065497,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effective treatment', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'efficacy outcomes', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'pulmonary function', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,236163
"Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy Abstract Socket augmentation after tooth extraction by placing either allograft or xenograft bone particulates in the socket is frequently applied to reduce jawbone volume shrinkage for subsequent implant placement. Socket healing after the augmentation varies largely, ranging from uneventful healing to infection, failure of bone graft integration and severe bone loss due to bacterial infection and/or local/systemic conditions. The healing duration, which dictates the timing of implant placement, is widely different as well. Currently, an arbitrary waiting time of 6 months after socket augmentation is adopted, when a 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D radiograph, along with a visual examination is performed to assess hard- and soft-tissue healing to determine the readiness and strategy for the subsequent implant surgery. However, 3D radiographs are not recommended for longitudinal use to monitor socket healing due to radiation concerns. They have lower image resolution (250-500 µm), which limits their ability to evaluate bone surface healing, and inferior soft tissue contrast. A non-radiation and point-of-care method that can evaluate both hard- and soft-tissue longitudinally is much needed for a definitive, accurate, and timely diagnosis of socket healing pathologies. A high-frequency and miniature-sized intraoral ultrasound probe that can operate on an off-the-shelf scanner has been manufactured in collaboration with industry (see support letter) by our research team. Research conducted by our group demonstrated accuracy of this probe in measuring various oral and dental structures. The central hypothesis is to develop ultrasound-based imaging to characterize and grade socket healing lesions in determining the extent and severity of disease. To test this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasonic images for bone grafting procedures of dental extraction sockets in a longitudinal clinical study (from -2 months to +6 months of graft placement). We will compare other imaging and clinical diagnostic tools for assessing hard- and soft tissue, anatomical and physiological status throughout the longitudinal study time-course. Aim 2. Develop an extended-view scan-mode for acquiring large field- of-view jawbone images and determine buccal (facial) to lingual tissue morphology. We will engage the manufacturer (see support letter) to modify the existing scanner for this dental specific application. Design goals will include the creation of an extended, large angle, field-of-view to visualize the buccal to lingual jaw bone surface and to create machine learning based measurement tools, including soft- and hard-tissue thickness and surface analysis. Successful execution of the proposed aims will result in an imaging-based tool for longitudinal socket augmentation evaluation that is based on soft- and hard-tissue features and will allow the care provider to choose deviation from current clinical procedures where indicated. This would be investigated subsequently in a specifically designed clinical trial. Narrative The goals of this investigation are to follow dental patients that require bone grafts before their dental implant is placed and to demonstrate the diagnostic opportunities that ultrasound adds to the current standard of clinical dental care. 3",Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy,10427073,R56DE030872,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Allografting', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Bone Surface', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Implants', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implantation procedure', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Inferior', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Jaw', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Particulate', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Extraction', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'bone', 'bone healing', 'bone loss', 'bone xenograft', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'dental structure', 'design', 'experience', 'graft failure', 'graft healing', 'healing', 'improved', 'oral care', 'point of care', 'soft tissue', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R56,2021,642438
"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user.

"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,10161608,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,787916
"Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation Efforts to keep the most vulnerable individuals with chronic medical conditions from being exposed to COVID- 19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom, traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR) software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5 physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis); a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation,10256844,R43AG072991,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Augmented Reality', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quarantine', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videoconferencing', 'Virtual Tool', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'gait examination', 'health care delivery', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'joint mobilization', 'new technology', 'outpatient programs', 'pandemic disease', 'partial recovery', 'patient safety', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'remote delivery', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'visual processing']",NIA,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2021,286972
"Imaging Goggles for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases, resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource- limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike.  Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head- mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow. The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical software to improve user experience.  At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide. This objective approach to cancer surgery will reduce the incidence of PSMs and improve treatment outcomes. Narrative  Optical imaging instruments have permeated medical practice because of their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. We have developed a wearable head- mounted display device that is augmented by visible and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tissues in real- time. In collaboration with an industry partner, we will optimize the device performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering.

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%.

Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10372655,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,52000
"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410
"Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills Complicated and costly robot assisted surgery (RAS) training results in less frequent use of this technology in several complex areas of surgery, and consequently ends up in harm. RAS requires a unique blend of skills in addition to manual competence with human-machine interaction skills, while operating remotely from patient with no tactile feedback. To address this challenge, numerous studies have focused on simulation-based robotic training curricula, like Fundamental Skills of Robotic Surgery (FSRS), to develop and assess the performance level of the surgeon operator. However, such training tools were developed based on metrics measured by performance on a simulator and other subjectively evaluated metrics. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring. We hypothesize that brain dynamics - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - and eye movement behavior are able to detect change of skill level and the level of surgeon’s performance. To validate this hypothesis, we will record EEG signals and eye movement time series from subjects with different RAS expertise levels. Ten novices, 5 beginners, 5 advanced beginners, and 5 expert surgeons will be included in the study and continuously perform four levels of designed RAS training tasks on surgical robot simulator, dry lab, and animal lab during one year; (1) performing six basic tasks on surgical simulator. All subjects will practice these tasks during two weekly sessions and each practice session takes 2 hours. (2) Subjects will practice 3 tasks of peg transfer, pattern cutting, and suturing on dry lab. (3) Subjects will practice 2 tasks (anastomosis and dissection) on animal tissue and also on plastic models. (4) Subjects will practice two operations of nephrectomy and hysterectomy on animal lab, 2 operations in each session, and each session takes 3 hours and occurs every other week. Two master surgeons will subjectively evaluate performance of subjects (all 25 subjects; Score scale: 1-20) and expertise level (four categories) in performing the designed tasks, every practice session. Master surgeons evaluate surgeon’s skill and performance throughout task and notify change of skill level and performance through time. We will then develop a ‘deep convolutional neural network’ algorithm trained by EEG and eye movement time series through running windows with equal size, to classify subject skill level into four categories of a novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and expert. We will also use network neuroscience techniques to extract engineered features from EEG and eye movement data and use them for training a regression algorithm to develop a model for performance level prediction. Ultimately, the developed objective skill evaluation tool and performance monitoring model will make RAS training more efficient by providing feedback to the trainee regarding his/her skills and directing him/her to focus on skills needed improvement. These improvements will result in more frequent use of RAS in complex surgical areas and ultimately lead to patient safety. Project Narrative The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has offered advantages for surgeons and patients, yet there is no clinically practical tool for objective evaluation of subject’s expertise level and performance. The overall objective of this research is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring, leading to optimized RAS training process, improved patient safety and surgical outcomes.",Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills,10133651,R01EB029398,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wrist', 'adaptive learning', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'animal tissue', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'motor learning', 'neural network algorithm', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'regression algorithm', 'robot assistance', 'robotic device', 'robotic training', 'safety outcomes', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,385213
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the US. The management of glaucoma is based on early detection, followed by careful evaluation and monitoring to identify those with rapid disease progression and high risk for vision loss. This allows for the rational use of medical, laser, and surgical treatments. Current methods of assessing glaucoma have significant limitations. Visual field (VF) testing has a low sensitivity for detecting early disease, and its reproducibility worsens in advanced stages, reducing its reliability for monitoring disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) precisely measure the peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness and is the most commonly used technology for objective glaucoma evaluation. However, NFL thickness has limited sensitivity in detecting early glaucoma, and reaches a floor value in moderate glaucoma, which prevents it from tracking glaucoma progress into later stages. The goal of the proposed research is to develop advanced OCT technology that will enhance detection of early glaucoma, improve the sensitivity of detecting significant disease progression, and increase the accuracy of measuring progression speed. The Specific Aims are: 1. Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve imaging of  structure and perfusion. The prototype will have real-time control of beam direction to maintain  perpendicular incidence on the NFL for accurate reflectance analysis, which has shown promise for very  sensitive detection of early glaucoma. Sensorless adaptive-optics aberration correction will enable high  transverse resolution to enhance the detection of nerve fiber bundle and capillary defects. Ultrahigh axial  resolution will enable assessment of the pentalaminar structure of the inner plexiform layer. 2. Wide-field OCT and OCT angiography analyses and visual field simulation. Wide peripapillary and  macular scans, using a next-generation commercial spectral-domain OCT system, will allow visualization of  nerve fiber and perfusion defects from the disc margin to temporal raphe, thus improving early glaucoma  detection. VF simulation will be performed to convert OCTA perfusion measurement to a VF-equivlaent dB-  scale familiar to clinicians for monitoring progression. The simulation has higher reproducibility than actual  VF, which improves detection of disease progression and measurement of progression speed. 3. Clinical studies in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. The clinical study will test whether the  proposed new technologies can improve the detection of pre-perimetric glaucoma, detection of disease  progression, and the accuracy of measuring the speed of progression. This research is likely to transform the clinical practice of glaucoma by developing novel objective functional and structural tests that can be practically implemented on the next generation of clinical OCT systems. This will save vision by achieving accurate diagnosis in early glacuoma and timely intervention in rapid progressors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging technology that is already commonly used to diagnose and monitor glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, and provide more accurate monitoring of disease progression. Directional OCT technology will be developed to accurately measure nerve fiber layer reflectance; sensorless adaptive-optics OCT technology will be used to improve imaging of nerve fiber bundles and capillaries; ultrahigh axial resolution will enable imaging of detailed internal retinal structures such as the lamellae of the inner plexiform layer; and capillary perfusion measurements will be used to simulate visual field function.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,10211838,R01EY023285,"['3-Dimensional', 'Angiography', 'Blindness', 'Blood capillaries', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Nose', 'Open-Angle Glaucoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Questionnaires', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adaptive optics', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep neural network', 'field study', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macula', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optic nerve disorder', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'tool']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,624917
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,10194566,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'effectiveness testing', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'ventilation', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulator']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,314927
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources. We will also conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities, use machine learning for risk predictions, and implement active surveillance for devices and technologies.",Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs).,10209943,U01FD006936,[' '],FDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U01,2021,50000
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Digital Melt Curve Analysis Platform for Longitudinal Cancer Patient Monitoring Abstract  Building on its commercially available Absolute Q digital PCR platform, during the 24-month Phase 2 SBIR project, Combinati will complete the development of the first Digital Melt Curve Analysis (DMCA) platform to the market to further advance the adoption of digital genomics for highly accurate, sensitive and reproducible nucleic acid quantification for longitudinal patient monitoring. To provide the “whole product” solution and prove the function, we will demonstrate the DMCA platform with Luminex’s 11- plex ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) assay and conduct Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute: 1. Three beta instruments and the analysis software capable of digital melt curve analysis. 2. Complete dMCA validation internally with commercially available melt calibration kits. 3. Demonstrate <0.1% Mutation Allele Frequency of 11 cell-free DNA targets using Luminex  Corporation’s discrete melt assay. 4. Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute Narrative  Since PCR was invented back in 1983, it has become the gold standard for applications requiring quantification of nucleic acids. The continuous evolution of the technology enables PCR to be more quantitative (qPCR), more accurate, precise and reproducible (digital PCR). In parallel, with the invention of melt curve analysis in 1997, it opens another dimension in melt temperatures for applications requiring simple and inexpensive genotyping, high degree qualitative multiplexing without sequencing, and assay optimization. Despite that there is a handful of dPCR platforms in the market, none of them supports Melt Curve Analysis.

"High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart Project Summary Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Function Study', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glean', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intelligence', 'Ion Channel', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Lysosomes', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Opsin', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Side', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cardioprotection', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart rhythm', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrument', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'preconditioning', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,529434
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,621465
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,10197880,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,574725
"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Contralateral', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysplasia', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Hand', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oral Characters', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Squamous Cell', 'Surgical margins', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'analog', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'imaging probe', 'imaging properties', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'oral lesion', 'oral tissue', 'premalignant', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'programs', 'response', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice.

"Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi- center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gauging electrical properties of surgical margins during tumor resection procedures has the potential to alert surgeons to regions of cancer not fully extracted and subsequently reduce the number of positive surgical margins which are significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. The intraoperative electrical property sensing/imaging probe and the visualization tools proposed here will provide an accurate, rapid, and cost- effective method for gauging these surgical margins for multiple cancer types. We will explore this technology in the context of prostate cancer surgery with the expectation that this will further advance the study of electrical property signatures of normal and diseased tissue in vivo and help to translate this technology to the clinic.",Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment,10218115,R01CA237654,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bladder Control', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nephrectomy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pelvic floor structure', 'Periprostatic', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Urethra', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'expectation', 'feasibility trial', 'flexibility', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'man', 'men', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'programs', 'prostate surgery', 'prototype', 'safety and feasibility', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'urinary bladder neck']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,478142
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,10158551,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,638854
"Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy More than 1/3 of the world’s 65 million people with epilepsy (~3.3 million in the U.S.) have seizures that cannot be controlled by medications. Surgery and implanted devices are options for many, but their success depends upon manually mapping epileptic networks, which is only possible for some patients, and poorly standardized. When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care. Over the first four years of this grant we have made substantial progress towards these goals. Our deliverables include: (1) robust measures derived from intracranial EEG (IEEG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery; (2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and iEEG; and (4) a track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on our platform http: //ieeg.org. In the next phase, we propose innovative solutions to 3 fundamental challenges in epilepsy surgery required to translate our work into practice: (1) Guiding SEEG: We must adapt our methods to the sparser sampling and different philosophy of stereo EEG, which maps a network of connected brain regions and tests clinical hypotheses about where seizures initiate and propagate; (2) Assessing sampling bias and missing information: We will develop methods to determine if electrodes sample all key regions of the epileptic network, to ensure we do not falsely localize due to missing information; (3) Validating in a larger population across centers: In parallel to refining the above methods, we will validate and optimize our analyses in a large number of patients to ready this work for a prospective clinical trial. In a novel model, we have engaged a group of major surgical epilepsy centers to openly collaborate, standardize methods, aggregate data, and share all algorithms, computer code, data and results on http: //ieeg.org. Our central hypothesis is that standardized, quantitative methods to guide epilepsy surgery can improve patient outcomes, lower morbidity, reduce cost and enable uniform, higher quality care across centers. This work is significant because it merges state of the art network neuroscience, engineering, neurology and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care. This project leverages a thriving collaboration between experts in neurology, computational neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroimaging and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania that has generated 58 publications related to this proposal. We now extend this collaboration to academic epilepsy centers across the United States and worldwide. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing new quantitative methods to target and test epilepsy surgery in computer models before doing these procedures in the operating room will improve patient outcomes and reduce surgery side effects and costs. In this research we are also working with 15 major epilepsy centers to standardize treatment. For these reasons the proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission to foster fundamental, creative discoveries and innovative research strategies that will ultimately protect and improve human health for the United States’ 3.3 million people with epilepsy.",Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy,10355919,R56NS099348,"['Ablation', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diffuse', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Sampling Errors', 'Seizures', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer code', 'cost', 'data standards', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2021,551628
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955
"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000
"Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY In this competitive renewal for R01 CA187427, we will continue to advance label-free Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to enhance the functionality of the widely-used da Vinci Surgical platform with an emphasis on Trans-Oral-Robotic-Surgery (TORS). UC Davis has pioneered the intra-operative use of FLIm and our partner, Intuitive Surgical, is the global leader in robotic-assisted surgery. To date, we have demonstrated a) the synergetic integration of a point-scanning FLIm device with the da Vinci Surgical System (first-of-its-kind); b) the potential of this approach to improve surgical decision-making during TORS without modifying conventional clinical protocols; and c) the utility of FLIM-derived parameters detecting biochemical and metabolic characteristics to distinguish oral and oropharyngeal cancer in real-time from surrounding normal tissue in patients in-situ.. We also developed innovative methods for real-time dynamic augmentation of imaging parameters on the surgical field of view. Capitalizing on the major accomplishments and knowledge gained under the current R01, the overarching objective of this renewal application is to 1) demonstrate FLIm’s diagnostic value in prospective studies by accounting for biological/experimental variables identified as critical under the current R01 and leveraging pre-operative imaging and clinical information and 2) enhance the visualization of FLIm-based classifiers on the surgeon console for real-time intraoperative feedback. To accomplish our overall objective, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Expand the FLIm database and develop tissue-type classifiers (retrospective analysis) accounting for biological variables (e.g., patient age/sex, tumor origin/location) and experimental situations (e.g., epithelial surface vs deep margins, tumors of an unknown primary) and the pre- operative imaging (CT, PET) features used in surgical planning. Aim 2. Develop, validate and perform regulatory activities for enhanced FLIm data visualization in support of prospective clinical studies. Aim 3. Validate FLIm as a means of real-time intraoperative TORS guidance in a prospective study analysis. In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time assessment of oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgical margins. The acquired FLIm parameter database will enable subsequent large clinical trials for automated tissue classification and diagnostic prediction. While the focus of this application is on TORS surgeries, the label-free FLIm-based tissue assessment, characterized by simple, fast and flexible data acquisition and display, can be broadly applied to other procedures as the da Vinci Surgical System is used in a wide range of tumor surgeries including urologic, colorectal, gynecologic, and thoracic cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optimal cancer and functional outcomes from surgical treatment of head and neck cancer requires the surgeon to have the ability to intraoperatively distinguish neoplastic disease from adjacent normal tissue. Our novel optical imaging FLIm technique, coupled to the da Vinci surgical system, captures and analyzes tissue autofluorescence to identify distinct tissue types and display this information onto the surgeon’s field of view during trans-oral- robotic surgery (TORS). This enables a more accurate and optimal cancer removal while preserving adjacent normal tissue and function. The successful validation of FLIm, with the sophisticated incorporation of head and neck cancer patient and radiology data to improve the tissue classifier, will allow for more cures with less long- term side effects and will be easily extended to other robotic and endoscopic procedures, thus advancing innovation well beyond TORS.",Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance,10211948,R01CA187427,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cauterize', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hemostatic function', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Risk Management', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer surgery', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional outcomes', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'image registration', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'robotic system', 'sex', 'side effect', 'solid state', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'surgery outcome', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,633669
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10202460,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2021,749956
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Atrophic', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age-related muscle loss', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data visualization', 'design', 'diaries', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'muscle form', 'muscle regeneration', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'resistance exercise', 'sarcopenia', 'sensor', 'strength training', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Automated Assessment for Robotic Suturing Utilizing Deep Learning Algorithms ABSTRACT Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US at a cost of $20 billion annually. Surgical complications account for a third of these deaths and cost. Surgical performance directly impacts patient outcomes. Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is treated with surgery (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)) that can lead to impotence, incontinence, and even death. Reliable means of objectively assessing technique are required. In this project we will focus on assessing surgeon suturing skills during RARP through virtual reality (VR) simulation. Suturing is a common skill in many types of surgeries, can be tracked with performance metrics, and has been correlated with patient outcomes after RARP. In this proposal we seek to first determine the critical sub-step maneuvers of suturing and the technical skills necessary to achieve them successfully (Aim 1a). Further, we intend to develop an automated skills assessment pipeline through the analysis of raw kinematic data (Aim 1b), video (Aim 2b), and both kinematic/video (Aim 2c), from VR simulation performance by innovative machine learning strategies and deep-learning-based computer vision. The primary differentiator of the proposed work is determining how well granular sub-step maneuvers in suturing are performed. Surgeons participating in this study will not only provide data through their VR simulation performance, but will also contribute real patient data from the RARP to establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and surgical outcomes. Statistical modeling will measure the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient factors to patient outcomes (Aim 3). We hypothesize that innovative application of machine learning algorithms can accurately assess surgeon technical skills, and can further anticipate likelihood of relevant clinical outcomes. The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback in VR, empowering surgeons with valuable knowledge to minimize surgical risk in live surgery.

"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133
"Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK) PROJECT SUMMARY  Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes, utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep- learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).  DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However, the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively. In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.  Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO- DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,10218258,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,646449
"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,10163822,R21CA250024,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Science', 'Nutritional status', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respondent', 'Restaurants', 'Side', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'dietary', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'food quality', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'prototype', 'success', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'virtual model', 'wasting', 'weight maintenance']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2021,197745
"Cooperative Control Robotics and Computer Vision: Development of Semi-Autonomous Temporal Bone and Skull Base Surgery Project Summary I am an assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where my practice is focused on neurotology and lateral skull base surgery. I am applying for a mentored surgeon-scientist career development award (CDA) to obtain further training in robotics, deep learning and computer vision. This will further my long-term career goals of improving neurotologic surgical outcomes through novel applications of engineering methods and ultimately to investigate semi-autonomous, robotic interventions in the inner ear and skull base which are beyond the limits of the human hand alone.  Operating in the temporal bone and lateral skull base is technically demanding due to complex three- dimensional anatomy, small working spaces and delicate neurovascular structures. Many of these challenges are ideally suited to semi-autonomous surgical platforms to augment a surgeon’s skills with robotic and image- guided assistance. Despite the widespread implementation of robotic surgery and image guidance in other areas of the body, the field of neurotology has had relatively little adoption of this technology. We believe one reason for this is the precise registration needed in this field, where millimeter differences differentiate a successful from a catastrophic result. This CDA proposes expanding on my prior work investigating cooperative control robotics and virtual safety barriers by using computer vision and deep learning networks to develop highly accurate surgical image registration. This CDA aims to provide me with multi-disciplinary training in the departments of Otolaryngology, Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Specific training goals include: (1) Training in robotics, statistical shape modeling and computer tomography landmark segmentation, (2) Training in deep learning networks and computer vision video image registration, (3) Integrating this training, with my knowledge of temporal bone and skull base surgery to develop into an independent investigator (4) Pursue additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.  The research plan addresses the hypothesis that virtual safety barriers can be accurately enforced by a cooperative control robot, and computer vision methods can be used to automate accurate placement and registration of these safety barriers. I believe that the integration of these techniques will allow for semi- autonomous surgical methods resulting in improved surgical safety and efficiency. The specific aims of the proposal are to: (1) Develop and Validate Cooperative Control Robot Enforced Virtual Safety Barriers for Cortical Mastoidectomy (2) Develop and Test Autonomous Segmentation of Lateral Skull Base Anatomy (3) Develop Video-Based, Fiducial-less, Surgical Image Registration to Detect and Update the 3-D Position of Temporal Bone Anatomy from Intraoperative Stereoscopic Microscope Video. Project Narrative The research proposed here will investigate the feasibility of using novel applications of computer vision and cooperative control robotics to enforce virtual safety barriers in neurotologic surgery.

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300
"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners.

"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Animal Experiments', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biofeedback', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood flow', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Choices and Control', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'E-learning', 'Early Mobilizations', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Shock', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coronary perfusion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'time interval']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,547699
"Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors Technological advancements continue to improve surgical outcomes. However, these technologies also introduce new challenges such as communication complexities, equipment troubleshooting under intense pressure, and higher cognitive demand on OR team members. In other words, surgery will continue to be risky despite technological improvements. There is evidence the number of avoidable complications may be underreported, that approximately 39% of in-hospital adverse events are surgical related, and that as many as 4,000 surgical never events (events which should not have occurred) happen in the US each year. The eventual goal of this research is to develop an automated detection system (ADS) of high- risk surgical states. The ADS will prevent surgical safety incidents before they occur through real-time monitoring and notification of appropriate operating room (OR) team members ahead- of-time if there is a looming risk. Thereby allowing the team to reconsider next steps and address the underlying issues, and hence reduce the rates of negative surgical outcomes. This project demonstrates the feasibility and merit of essential components for an ADS. Specifically, the surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, therefore it is likely that a future ADS will model and monitor surgical state through tracking flow disruptions. Our current aims are to (1) finish implementation of the Research & Exploratory Analysis Driven Time-data Visualization (READ-TV) research tool; open-source software to visualize FD patterns and other longitudinal data. (2) Develop a stochastic model to predict whether high-risk, disruptive FD sequences will occur based on FD rates at earlier time points. (3) Link FD patterns and sequences with surgical outcomes by developing a text classifier to identify whether or not a surgical safety incident or near-miss occurred based on the associated EHR note. The classifier will be a deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of surgical EHR notes. The text analysis in the third aim will provide insight to FD types and sequences that are more error prone, thereby revealing the FD patterns that an ADS should warn an OR team to avoid. Additional benefits of this text analysis include a possible confirmation of the existence of incident underreporting. Upon completion of the 3 aims, we will have a computational foundation for an ADS: our research tool (aim 1: READ-TV visualization software) and analyses (aim 3: link flow disruptions to safety incidents through EHR note analysis) will advance interpretation of flow disruption (FD) sequences, and our stochastic models (aim 2: predict future surgical state from FD sequences) will prospectively predict error-prone states. This foundation can be extended in future projects through research in automatic transcription of flow disruptions, and the proper mode of alert delivery if the surgery is prone to enter an error-prone state. Surgery by nature is risky for the patient and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future despite technological advancements. The surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, and we propose that an automated detection system (ADS) can detect if a surgery has an entered a high-risk state through monitoring of FD sequences, thereby alerting the OR team and preemptively preventing a safety incident. As the first steps for such a system: our research visualization tool (Aim 1) will advance interpretation and clustering of FD sequences, our text-based artificial intelligence models (Aim 3) will link FD patterns and surgery characteristics to safety incidents through computational analysis of over 150,000 surgical notes, and our stochastic models (Aim 2) will verify that a high-risk surgical state can be predicted ahead-of-time by monitoring disruption sequences.",Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors,10149122,F31LM013402,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Surgical Error', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detection platform', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'robot assistance', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,F31,2021,43491
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation.",Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation,10187566,R01EB028278,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Catheters', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal Fistula', 'Family suidae', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Microbubbles', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Navigation System', 'Necrotic Lesion', 'Ontario', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'novel', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'robot assistance', 'therapy outcome', 'time use']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,379119
"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auras', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Community Hospitals', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focal Seizure', 'Forehead', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective therapy', 'encryption', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'remote monitoring', 'sensor', 'social', 'standard of care']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,999853
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,10221562,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,404743
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Label', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Science', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Update', 'Volition', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dietary', 'effective intervention', 'field study', 'good diet', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mimetics', 'neural network', 'obesity management', 'operation', 'overweight adults', 'robotic system', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303
"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,10296166,R01EB005807,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Board Certification', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Floor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Israel', 'Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Medical center', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Nursing', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Software Framework', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'computer generated', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'distraction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'eye hand coordination', 'handheld mobile device', 'head mounted display', 'healing', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interactive computing', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'skills', 'skills training', 'stressor', 'success', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'virtual patient', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual surgery']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654073
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",10086996,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,734363
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'haptic feedback', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'software development', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419
"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time. This paradigm shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality, safety and longevity of pediatric cardiovascular care.",Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm.,10162386,R01HL143468,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '4D MRI', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Descending aorta', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Inferior vena cava structure', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Management', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Vascular Graft', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Work', 'aortic arch', 'base', 'clinical application', 'congenital anomaly', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mechanical properties', 'model design', 'mortality', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'performance tests', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'response', 'scaffold', 'shear stress', 'surgery outcome', 'vascular tissue engineering']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,643908
"Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity. Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough. Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment. The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument, we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk” and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care, provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening, enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies. Project Narrative Colorectal cancers (CRC) are among the leading causes of death from cancers in the US. Morphologically assessing excised tissue is the gold standard but requires fixation, staining, microscopy and pathology review, taking days and the information not being especially prognostic. This project develops an alternate technology based on chemical imaging evaluation that can provide an assessment within minutes, resulting in a new instrument, artificial intelligence methods for histology and microenvironment-powered prediction of disease course.",Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging,10318008,R01CA260830,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Color', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Fourier Transform', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immersion', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Chemicals', 'Laboratory Technicians', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymph Node Involvement', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Polyps', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'coronavirus disease', 'deep learning', 'design', 'design and construction', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human data', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'real-time images', 'rural setting', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'technology validation', 'tissue archive', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,466088
"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,10203886,R01CA240771,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Dermatologist', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Grant', 'Hutchinson&apos', 's Melanotic Freckle', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'blind', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preservation', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'vector']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,641977
"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4.

"Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine ABSTRACT Despite annual investments of >$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products, and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting, labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities, but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies, mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria. Malaria claims upwards of 600,000 human lives each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials. The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based crucially involves a currently labor-intensive process of mosquito salivary gland extraction entirely by manual dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first introduce an interim semi-automated dissection fixture for this process. In parallel efforts, incorporating automation in key steps of mosquito decapitation, and extraction of glands will lead to greater efficiencies, reduce timeframes, greatly reduce training times, mitigate human error and operator fatigue while maintaining product purity and quality that is thought to underlie an incredible safety record of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines. These outcomes will accelerate Sanaria’s march to licensure and production of commercial-scale volumes required to meet demand for post-licensure distribution to populations with greatest need, world- wide.",Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine,10258416,R44AI134500,"['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Authorization documentation', 'Automation', 'Body part', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Culicidae', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Decapitation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissection', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Geometry', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Insecta', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Licensure', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molds', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Salivary Glands', 'Scheme', 'Sporozoites', 'Stainless Steel', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vaccines', 'Vision', 'base', 'cGMP production', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'fight against', 'human error', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'process optimization', 'protective efficacy', 'prototype', 'robotic system', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",R44,2021,1000000
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabidiol', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intoxication', 'Isoflurophate', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Observer Variation', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'acquired epilepsy', 'automated algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical research', 'screening', 'tool', 'valproate']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798
"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables.

"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Project Summary Title: Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive device-based neuromodulation technique for probing neuronal networks and treating mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The treatment efficacy of TMS relies on placing TMS coils to accurately stimulate the underlying disease-related brain target. Since TMS-evoked electric field (E-field) is affected by complex tissue structures and brain geometry, it relies on using computational algorithms, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) and finite element modeling (FEM), to estimate the stimulation site. But the relative long computation time of these methods is a limitation for real-time visualization of the stimulation target during brain mapping and for computing the optimal coil position for treatment planning. In this grant, we propose to develop a deep-neural-network based method to accelerate E-field prediction. We will develop a novel deep-neural- network architecture to predict E-field by using training data computed using the FEM algorithm with anisotropic tissue conductivity. Then, we will integrate the trained neural network into a 3DSlicer software module for real- time E-field visualization. Moreover, we will develop a computational algorithm to search for the optimal coil position to maximize the stimulation of a selected brain target within a clinically feasible time. The outcome of this grant will transform deep-learning techniques into a useful tool to enhance the application of TMS in clinical research. Project Narrative Title: Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a device-based noninvasive neuromodulation technique to treat mental disorders. The treatment efficacy relies on accurate stimulating of the underlying disease-related brain target. To improve the targeting accuracy, we will use deep neural networks to develop a software for real-time prediction and visualization of the TMS-evoked electric field and to compute the optimal coil position to maximize the stimulation of disease-related targets.",Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation,10195450,R21MH126396,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Boundary Elements', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Grant', 'Helmet', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'electric field', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'white matter']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,277289
"Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs) PROJECT SUMMARY A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro- angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro- inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine the effects of diminished pulsatility during continuous flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) support on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Changes in production of pro- angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokines will be used as biomarkers to evaluate the effects of loss of pulsatility and help validate new approaches to introduce artificial pulsatility in CF-VADs.",Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs),10116660,R01HL151663,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Heart failure', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Sheep', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transducers', 'Translating', 'VWF gene', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety testing', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,535547
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10178133,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,422740
"An enhancement to nGoggle: a VR Goggle for Structural and Functional assessment in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY  Assessments of functional loss and of structural damage to the optic nerve are typical evaluations per- formed in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. This proposal aims at developing the hardware system that will allow acquisition of fundus photographs using the nGoggle, a portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which integrates a wearable, wireless, electroencephalogram (EEG) system and a head-mounted display to monitor electrical brain activities associated with visual field stimulation. In a previous project, we developed the nGoggle portable system for the assessment of visual function deficits in order to address limitations of standard automated perimetry (SAP), a traditional but subjective visual field test. We compared the diagnostic accuracies of the nGoggle and SAP in discriminating patients with glaucoma from healthy subjects and found that the BCI performed at least as well, if not better than SAP, with the additional advantage of portability and objectivity.  With rapid advancements in smartphone cameras, it is now possible to develop compact auto-focusing fundus cameras and integrate them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle. Recently we developed an approach named Machine-to-Machine (M2M), a deep learning algorithm that was trained to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuroretinal rim provided by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This approach opens up the possibility of using simple fundus photographs to extract quantitative information about neural damage in glaucoma. By combining functional assessment currently provided by the nGoggle with structural assessment capability, this new system would result in a very unique device capable of portable structural and functional assessment of optic nerve damage for a multitude of eye conditions, not limited to glaucoma, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations and non-glaucomatous optic neu- ropathies.  The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR project are (1) to incorporate a high-resolution auto-focusing fundus camera to the nGoggle head-mounted display in full compliance with ophthalmic instrument safety stand- ards and fundus camera functional standards, and (2) to demonstrate the ability of the nGoggle fundus camera to capture high-quality optical nerve images from a model eye. Successful development of this system will enable both structural and functional assessments of retinal conditions to be performed easily and inexpensively using a portable device. PROJECT NARRATIVE NGoggle Inc. proposes to develop a new wearable ophthalmic diagnostic instrument capable of performing con- current structural and functional assessment to diagnose and monitor optic neuropathies and retinal diseases. This project aims at developing a pair of compact high-resolution fundus cameras in full compliance with oph- thalmic instrument safety standards and integrating them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle, an instrument with the demonstrated capability of estimating functional vision loss in glaucoma patients based on their electroen- cephalogram (EEG) responses evoked by visual stimuli. We also intend to demonstrate that the optic nerve images of model eyes taken by the integrated fundus cameras can yield consistent and compatible cup-to-disc ratios when compared with the measurements obtained from the same model eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT). After successful demonstration, we plan to conduct clinical tests in the subsequent phase of this project.",An enhancement to nGoggle: a VR Goggle for Structural and Functional assessment in Glaucoma,10253661,R43EY032820,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Flare', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Glaucoma', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nerve', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Visual impairment', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain electrical activity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'detection test', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'field study', 'functional loss', 'gaze', 'hazard', 'head mounted display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'loss of function', 'neural network algorithm', 'optic nerve disorder', 'patient response', 'portability', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'visual stimulus', 'wearable device']",NEI,"NGOGGLE, INC.",R43,2021,299600
"Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation ABSTRACT Science: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 days of surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission to intensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, which entails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolar recruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILI and ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yield the lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilator parameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine the incidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; (2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severity of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive models of the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilator parameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation for postdoctoral training. Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using data science to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I have three short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design to enhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques for conducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow me protected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During the next twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2) advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE This retrospective observational study leveraging electronic health records will improve our understanding of risks for lung complications after surgery that are associated with high mortality and morbidity.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target.

"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vial device', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical appointment', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138
"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,10086887,R01HL150147,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Birth', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Lung', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Respiration', 'Rod', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Vital capacity', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'health assessment', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment effect', 'ventilation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,769122
