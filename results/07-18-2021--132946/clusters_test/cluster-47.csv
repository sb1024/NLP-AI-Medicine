"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Social Desirability', 'Social support', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning community', 'model design', 'object recognition', 'organizational structure', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'response', 'social cognition', 'social engagement', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tool', 'vision development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,377473
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer. The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification at UC Davis will use advanced experimental and computational mass spectrometry methods to significantly improve compound identification rates in metabolomics.

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",10177978,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2021,744955

"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation.

This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services.
