"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9564312,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Libraries', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2017,54232,111231681
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9248725,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'screening', 'systems research', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2016,98294,9289790
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.

Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping,9481767,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'information model', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2017,100000,9289790
"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare. Project Narrative. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will prepare the candidate to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI researcher pursing a research program on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic information. The study examines the values and assumptions underlying conceptualizations of the actionability of genomic information for healthy populations.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in precision medicine are making it increasingly possible to tailor healthcare decisions based on the individual patient’s genomic risk profile. However, large-scale validation studies of risk prediction accuracy and its clinical utility are severely lacking in diverse populations. The goal of this eMERGE-IV project is to leverage genetic and electronic health record data for diverse populations to design, optimize, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases of high public health impact.",EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations,10201799,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Stratification', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'design', 'discrete data', 'diverse data', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'literacy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical ability', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'patient oriented', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'risk perception', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'structural genomics', 'tailored health care', 'tool', 'trait', 'trial design', 'user centered design', 'validation studies']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,121251,558628098
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.

"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,685608202
"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,146629556
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7688756,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Elevation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'development policy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'patient registry', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2008,219307,148927
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8514888,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2012,279834,276703803
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics.

"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9544417,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,399949,558628098

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies. This PheWAS proposal will develop new methods to identify detailed phenotypes and diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations,9332465,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catalogs', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,458957,377931988
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).

"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10034691,"['Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'electronic data', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486125,593605914
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9894990,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'education resources', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,707923,111231681
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9902000,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2019,730148,9289790
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,551214295

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III, we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders–familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)–we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity.

"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,551214295
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity.

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned to discover genetic variants relevant to human health and to implement genomic medicine to improve patient care.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electronic medical record (EMR) can be leveraged for high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of patients for genomics research. As part of eMERGE-l, we used EMR-based algorithms to enable genome- wide association studies (GWAS) of several primary and network-wide phenotypes. The present application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. The Mayo eMERGE-ll cohort (n=6916) includes the 3769 eMERGE-l patients and an additional 3147 individuals, the majority (90%) genotyped on the same lllumina 660W platform. We will work with other eMERGE-ll sites to expand and validate the library of electronic phenotyping algorithms to enable GWAS of multiple phenotypes of interest. A major focus of our application is to translate recent GWAS findings to clinical practice. Our specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Conduct EMR-based GWAS to identify common genetic variants that influence a) inter-individual variation in cardiorespiratory fitness and response to statin medications and b) susceptibility to venous thromboembolism and colon polyps. Specific aim 2. Quantify genetic risk of a common 'complex' disease - coronary heart disease (CHD) - and an adverse drug response - statin myopathy. We will develop risk communication tools that convey the clinical and genetic components of risk to both patients and care providers. Specific aim 3. Develop informatics approaches to incorporate genomic data into the EMR, including links to clinical decision support. Specific aim 4. Conduct a randomized-clinical trial to investigate how patients respond to genetically informed CHD-risk. We will re-consent 150 eMERGE-l patients without CHD, communicate the results via a genetic counselor, and discuss in detail the implications of the testing relevant to disease risk. The effectiveness of the communication and the patients' comprehension of risk, their hopes and concerns, and planned changes in lifestyle will be assessed by surveys and interviews after the patient-counselor encounter. As part of our ongoing efforts in community consultation, we will establish a community advisory group specific to this project.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed application will leverage the research infrastructure established in eMERGE-l to identify common genetic variants that influence medically important phenotypes. We will develop tools to incorporate genomic information in the EMR. In addition, we will investigate clinical, translational, and ethical aspects of genetic testing for complex diseases and assess the response of patients to genetic testing.              n/a",EMR Phenotype and Community Engaged Genomic Associations,8520368,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bioethics', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic library', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'fitness', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heart disease risk', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NHGRI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2013,951710,276703803

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9134844,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2016,996374,148927
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases.

"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,327644200
"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in precision medicine are making it increasingly possible to tailor healthcare decisions based on the individual patient’s genomic risk profile. However, large-scale validation studies of risk prediction accuracy and its clinical utility are severely lacking in diverse populations. The goal of this eMERGE-IV project is to leverage genetic and electronic health record data for diverse populations to design, optimize, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases of high public health impact.",EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations,9988801,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Stratification', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'design', 'discrete data', 'diverse data', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'literacy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical ability', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'patient oriented', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'risk perception', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'structural genomics', 'tailored health care', 'tool', 'trait', 'trial design', 'user centered design', 'validation studies']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,1336256,558628098
"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return. Project Narrative As part of the eMERGE IV (E4) Network clinical trial, we propose to develop 5, and investigate the implementation of 15, “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a large set of diverse participants.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.
