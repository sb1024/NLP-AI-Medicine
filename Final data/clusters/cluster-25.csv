"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. The potential impact is significant given that increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% could positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year in the US alone. Thus, our team is developing an X-ray angiographic analysis system (DeepAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. In Phase I, the PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms was used to build our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model. We achieved a 0.89 Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic (AUROC) for identifying obstructive CAD in images with expert scored ground truth (exceeding our proposed Phase I milestone of >0.85 AUROC). Now in Phase II, we present an innovative image learning pipeline to incorporate anatomical and spatiotemporal information from video sequences (similar to a cardiologist reader). A full end to end X-ray angiography video processing pipeline will be developed and tested in a new cohort of 10,000 patient angiograms with normal and graded abnormal CAD. Our patch-based frame analysis model will advance to CNN full frame-based classification of angiographic views (left heart vs. right heart) and segmentation of coronary vessels (LAD, LCx, and RCA). A multiple frame analysis approach enabled by a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) will equip our model with dynamic temporal information to estimate lesion presence accurately. Our goal for Phase II is to improve reading specificity and translate our Phase I proof of concept research findings into a clinically meaningful tool. A multi-reader, multi-case evaluation by a group of interventional cardiologists interpreting with and without DeepAngio predictions will assess clinical usability to improve coronary stenosis estimation. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with DeepAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we will develop DeepAngio, a novel computer-assistive technology to enhance cardiologist’s angiographic reading process. It is our hope that this technology will increase the accuracy of diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning,9777388,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Aid', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary lesion', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'group intervention', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recursive neural network', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,24447,951823

Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) offers a computed measure of disease severity. However, the time and training required to perform QCA has largely relegated its use to research applications. Recent advances in deep learning for medical image analysis offer an opportunity to address this problem. The potential impact is significant given increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% can positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year. Thus, our team proposes to develop an X-ray angiographic analysis system (XAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development of XAngio by leveraging our team’s PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms with expert QCA scoring. In Phase I, we will teach XAngio how to read angiographic images and how to discriminate obstructive CAD. XAngio will employ a convolutional neural network, a computer vision technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize angiographic features from labeled images. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled images, XAngio will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of XAngio will test its ability to identify the presence of obstructive CAD in PROMISE angiogram images. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact on improving visual interpretation in a cohort of cardiologists. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning, big data from PROMISE, and scalable parallel computing to create XAngio. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with XAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation. PROJECT NARRATIVE While invasive x-ray angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool for guiding immediate treatment in the cardiac cath lab, visual interpretation of angiograms is challenging and subject to large inter- and intra-observer biases.

"Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PI: Madabhushi, Anant Early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) offers the best hope of curing it. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose CAP is through histological analysis of excised tissue, obtained via blind sextant trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsies. However, the accuracy of TRUS biopsies is only 20-25% for elevated PSA levels. Recently, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in visualizing prostatic structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer programs in assisting radiologists detect abnormalities from radiological images. The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy. However, several studies have reported (1) that using PSA alone as a screening test results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and (2) there is a high false negative rate associated with TRUS. The goal of this work is to integrate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) with multi-protocol high resolution in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancer detection. The proposed work has translational implications in, structures (urethra and rectal wall) by directing therapy towards specific areas determined as tumor by CAD.           n/a",Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS,7844532,"['Agreement', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Detection', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urethra', 'Weight', 'Work', 'blind', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'men', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R21,2009,70267,67504980
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,10163298,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,75521,43994644
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies.

"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,0
"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6643700,"['artificial intelligence', ' atherosclerotic plaque', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R43,2003,99850,0
"Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid The objective of this project is to perform the initial development and evaluation of a computer aid to assist radiologists in their interpretation of mammograms. We will develop and evaluate an approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD(, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated. We will model the perceptual similarity between two lesion images as a non-linear function of those images, and use algorithms (support vector machines and artificial neural networks) to learn this function from similarity techniques that will allow the radiologist to refine the search by indicating preferences among the retrieved images, providing a capability similar to that present in text-search engines.

"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7295701,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Score', 'System', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R21,2007,151477,0
"Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PI: Madabhushi, Anant Early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) offers the best hope of curing it. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose CAP is through histological analysis of excised tissue, obtained via blind sextant trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsies. However, the accuracy of TRUS biopsies is only 20-25% for elevated PSA levels. Recently, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in visualizing prostatic structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer programs in assisting radiologists detect abnormalities from radiological images. The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy. However, several studies have reported (1) that using PSA alone as a screening test results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and (2) there is a high false negative rate associated with TRUS. The goal of this work is to integrate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) with multi-protocol high resolution in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancer detection. The proposed work has translational implications in, structures (urethra and rectal wall) by directing therapy towards specific areas determined as tumor by CAD.           n/a",Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS,7241154,"['Agreement', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Detection', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urethra', 'Weight', 'Work', 'blind', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'men', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R21,2007,160215,0

"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT.

The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,294146927
"Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PI: Madabhushi, Anant Early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) offers the best hope of curing it. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose CAP is through histological analysis of excised tissue, obtained via blind sextant trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsies. However, the accuracy of TRUS biopsies is only 20-25% for elevated PSA levels. Recently, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to ultrasound in visualizing prostatic structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) refers to the use of computer programs in assisting radiologists detect abnormalities from radiological images. The aim of this project is to develop a CAD system to detect prostate cancer from multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) Imaging (MRSI). The initial higher costs associated with MRI will be offset by a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and an increase in the number of cancers detected via biopsy. The long term goals of this work are to motivate use of CAD with high resolution MRI/MRSI:- 1. For early detection of CAP in moderate to high risk patients and thereby reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and radical prostatectomies. 2. Improving cancer detection rates by replacing TRUS with CAD-assisted MRI guided prostate biopsies. 3. For improved target dose conformality in prostate therapy. 4. For assessing quantitative response to anti-cancer therapy. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 10 tasks. A total of 40 anonymised patient data sets comprising multi-protocol 3 Tesla (T) in vivo MRI/MRSI scans before and multi-protocol 3 T ex vivo MRI/MRSI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after prostatectomy will be obtained (Aim 1). Four different MR protocols will be obtained for each patient study -- T1-, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion imaging. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of CAP regions via H&E staining. In order to train the CAD system to automatically identify CAP on in vivo MRI accurate determination of spatial location of cancer in vivo is required. Aim 2 involves determination of spatial extent of CAP (tumor ground truth) in vivo by first registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. Once the spatial location of CAP has been thus determined on ex vivo MRI, these images are then registered with the corresponding in vivo MRI studies. Aim 3 involves building and evaluating the CAD system for detecting CAP on the high resolution in vivo MRI and MRSI studies. This project will be a collaborative effort between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers. 1 PI: Madabhushi, Anant Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 230,000 new cases in the USA in 2004. The current protocol to diagnose CAP in the USA is to have patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels undergo a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-directed biopsy. However, several studies have reported (1) that using PSA alone as a screening test results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and (2) there is a high false negative rate associated with TRUS. The goal of this work is to integrate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) with multi-protocol high resolution in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancer detection. The proposed work has translational implications in, structures (urethra and rectal wall) by directing therapy towards specific areas determined as tumor by CAD.           n/a",Detecting Prostate Cancer using multi-protocol 3 Tesla in vivo MRI and MRS,7408622,"['Agreement', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Detection', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urethra', 'Weight', 'Work', 'blind', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'men', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R21,2008,172913,67504980

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,241268189

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease.

"Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Preliminary results from the PIOPED II study indicated a sensitivity of 83% by multi-detector CTPA. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE on CTPA scans and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include: (1) developing image preprocessing method to enhance vessel characteristics, (2) developing a new rolling balloon technique in combination with structure analysis to track vessels accurately, including vessels partially or completely occluded by PEs, (3) developing multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, especially for PEs in small subsegmental arteries, (4) analyzing PE features for development of classification methods, (5) developing false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (7) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.         n/a",Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography,7229841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Condition', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Opinions', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R21,2007,194580,0
"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,90419233
"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.

"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed deep-learning EC-CADe scheme for detecting small polyps and flat lesions in ultra-low-dose laxative-free spCTC (Deep-ECAD) will substantially improve reader performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients.

"Deep-radiomics-learning for mass detection in CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States. However, it would be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. The use of CT colonography (CTC) would substantially increase the access, capacity, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. The interpretation of CTC examinations would be most effective by use of a first-reader computer- aided detection (FR-CADe) paradigm, where a radiologist reviews only the lesion candidates detected automatically by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. However, because CADe systems can miss large masses, radiologists still need to perform an additional two-dimensional (2D) review of the CT images of the colon, which increases reading time over 40% on average. Furthermore, also radiologists can occasionally miss some types of masses on CTC images. The goal of this project is to develop a DEep RAdiomics LEarning (DERALE) scheme for the detection of large masses on CTC images. The scheme will be used to integrate deep learning methods and radiomic biomarkers to perform a complete automated review of CTC images for reliable detection of colorectal masses. We hypothesize that the DERALE scheme will be able to detect colorectal masses at a sensitivity comparable to that of unaided expert radiologists and that it can be used to reduce the interpretation time of FR- CADe without degrading diagnostic accuracy in CTC. We will evaluate and compare the classification performance of DERALE with that of unaided expert radiologists and conduct an observer performance study to compare the detection accuracy of the use of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm with that of unaided expert radiologists in the detection of masses from CTC images. Successful development and broad adoption of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm will facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce the mortality rate from colon cancer, one of the largest threats of cancer deaths in the United States. Project Narrative Successful development and validation of DERALE will substantially advance the clinical implementation of CTC and the FR-CADe paradigm in large populations to facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce mortality from colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States.

"Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a new modality that holds the promise of improving mammographic sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, especially for dense breasts. The main goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided detection (CADd) system for breast masses in DTM, (2) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of malignant and benign masses in DTM, and (3) to evaluate the effects of CAD (either CADd or CADx) on radiologists' interpretation of DTMs. Previous CAD systems are developed for regular projection mammograms (PMs).The proposed CAD system makes use of the 3-dimensional (3D) information in DTM to improve mass detection and characterization. The innovations in the proposed project include: (1) development of new computer-vision techniques to exploit the 3D volumetric information in DTMs, (2) evaluation of the dependence of CAD performance on reconstruction algorithms, and (3) comparison of computerized mass detection and characterization in DTMs, projection view mammograms (PVs) (the non-reconstructed mammograms taken at multiple angles during tomosynthesis imaging), and PMs. We hypothesize that detection and characterization of masses on DTMs will be more accurate than corresponding tasks on regular PMs, and that the CAD systems can improve radiologists' accuracy. 3D breast phantoms with test objects will be designed and imaged with a prototype DTM system. The dependence of DTM image quality on reconstruction algorithms and their parameters, and on image acquisition techniques will be studied. The appropriate reconstruction techniques will be selected based on phantom and patient studies. A database of DTMs and corresponding PMs with malignant and benign masses and a set of normal cases will be collected with patient informed consent. CAD systems for detection and classification of masses will be developed. Two approaches will be compared: one uses the reconstructed DTM slices and the other uses the PVs as input to the CAD systems. For the DTMs, new techniques for 3D preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature classification will be designed. For the PVs, our previous techniques developed for regular PMs will be adapted to these low- dose images, and information fusion methods using techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines will be developed to merge the multiple-PV information. To test our hypotheses, we will compare the CAD system performances from these two approaches and that from the corresponding regular PMs, and conduct observer ROC studies to evaluate effects of the CAD systems on radiologists' performance. CAD will be an important tool that can help accelerate the implementation of DTM in clinical practice.

"Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs.

"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) offers a computed measure of disease severity. However, the time and training required to perform QCA has largely relegated its use to research applications. Recent advances in deep learning for medical image analysis offer an opportunity to address this problem. The potential impact is significant given increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% can positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year. Thus, our team proposes to develop an X-ray angiographic analysis system (XAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development of XAngio by leveraging our team’s PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms with expert QCA scoring. In Phase I, we will teach XAngio how to read angiographic images and how to discriminate obstructive CAD. XAngio will employ a convolutional neural network, a computer vision technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize angiographic features from labeled images. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled images, XAngio will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of XAngio will test its ability to identify the presence of obstructive CAD in PROMISE angiogram images. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact on improving visual interpretation in a cohort of cardiologists. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning, big data from PROMISE, and scalable parallel computing to create XAngio. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with XAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation. PROJECT NARRATIVE While invasive x-ray angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool for guiding immediate treatment in the cardiac cath lab, visual interpretation of angiograms is challenging and subject to large inter- and intra-observer biases. In this project, we will develop and validate XAngio, a novel computer-assistive technology to enhance cardiologist’s angiographic reading and interpretation process. It is our hope that this technology will increase the accuracy of diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning,9466642,"['Address', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiac', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stenosis', 'Supervision', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2018,217746,951823
"A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysplasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop a based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for identification of regions at risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the esophagus. EAC is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%; yet the standard of care for detecting precursors to EAC is widely recognized to be inadequate. Just recently, a study found that 25% of patients who underwent a standard endoscopic surveillance exam which was found to be ‘clear’ then went on and progressed to EAC within one year. Clearly today’s approach is not working and a significant percentage of disease is being missed. While comprehensive esophageal OCT imaging has shown great potential in addressing this unmet clinical need, one of the main limiters to wider adoption and impact of this technology is the challenge of interpreting the large volume of high-resolution images in real-time. A CAD algorithm would allow OCT to realize its promise in this field and significantly improve the standard of care. Here we propose the development of a deep learning CAD algorithm which will operate on a full patient level volumetric dataset with awareness of the anatomy, robust against image quality and motion artifacts, and trained and validated against a large dataset (>1000 patients). We will aim to reach a sensitivity and specificity of 90/80% based on a threshold set by the American Society for Gastroenterology (ASGE) for the performance of advanced imaging in the detection of high grade dysplasia in BE. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for use with the NinePoint Medical OCT imaging system and provide early detection of pre-cancerous lesions.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,241268189
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0
"Automated coronary artery calcification scoring for cardiovascular risk screening ABSTRACT The World Health Organization lists cardiovascular disease as the most common cause of death worldwide at 31% of all deaths. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has become the most reliable predictor of future coronary artery disease (CAD) events in the asymptomatic population. CAC scores are currently only reported on ECG-gated CT examinations that are ordered when the primary indication is cardiac in nature. However, in 2007 there were 7.1 million non-cardiac thoracic CT scans ordered with lungs as the primary indication where CAC scores could have been reported. An additional 7-10 million CT lung screening scans are expected to be ordered per year as lung screening programs grow. Because lung cancer risk factors and CAD risk factors overlap significantly, most these patients could benefit greatly from having their CAC score reported as part of their non-cardiac CT examination. This could dramatically improve decision making, quality of care, and lower expenses due to future CAD interventions and cardiac specific CT scans. The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated software application that can report CAC scores on both gated and ungated thoracic CT scans with seamless integration into the Radiology workflow. A successful completion of this project will deliver a product capable of dramatically increasing the number of people that receive early intervention for CAD, thereby increasing quality of care and lowering costs. This Phase I application proposes first creating an algorithm capable of automatically calculating global CAC scores from both ECG-gated and ungated CT scans using CAC segmentations performed by an expert physician. If successful, the Phase II project will perform robust clinical validation adequate for an FDA 510(k) submission.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD.

"Information-Theoretic Based CAD in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a novel computer-assisted decision (CAD) scheme for improving the clinical detection of breast masses in screening mammograms. The CAD scheme combines information-theoretic similarity metrics with knowledge-based decision algorithms. It will help radiologists scrutinize mammograms providing evidence-based decision support. Given a query mammographic region, the CAD system will interrogate a database of archived mammograms, examine similar eases, and assign a likelihood measure regarding the presence of a potentially malignant mass.  The study proposes the formulation of information-theoretic metrics to quantify the similarity of two mammographic regions. The similarity metrics are based on Sharmon's entropy; a measure of complexity (or information) contained in an image. Theoretically, if two mammographic regions depict similar structures, they should contain diagnostic information for each other. The amount of relevant diagnostic information can be measured by entropy-based similarity metrics that are computed directly from the images without requiring segmentation or feature extraction. Using the similarity metrics and an image databank of mammographic cases with known truth, a knowledge-bussed CAD scheme will be implemented for the detection of masses in screening mammograms. Preliminary studies have established that standard mutual information (MI) is an effective similarity metric for the task.  The specific aims of the study are: (1) To fully exploit information-theoretic metrics that measure the similar content of two mammographic regions, (2) To optimize their contributions in an evidence-based decision algorithm for the early detection of potentially malignant masses, and (3) To perform preliminary clinical evaluation of the CAD system.  As digital image libraries are an upcoming trend in radiology, the proposed CAD system will take advantage of continuously deposited mammograms with established ground truth.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,90419233
"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies.

"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality.

"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed deep-learning EC-CADe scheme for detecting small polyps and flat lesions in ultra-low-dose laxative-free spCTC (Deep-ECAD) will substantially improve reader performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients.

"Deep-radiomics-learning for mass detection in CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States. However, it would be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. The use of CT colonography (CTC) would substantially increase the access, capacity, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. The interpretation of CTC examinations would be most effective by use of a first-reader computer- aided detection (FR-CADe) paradigm, where a radiologist reviews only the lesion candidates detected automatically by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. However, because CADe systems can miss large masses, radiologists still need to perform an additional two-dimensional (2D) review of the CT images of the colon, which increases reading time over 40% on average. Furthermore, also radiologists can occasionally miss some types of masses on CTC images. The goal of this project is to develop a DEep RAdiomics LEarning (DERALE) scheme for the detection of large masses on CTC images. The scheme will be used to integrate deep learning methods and radiomic biomarkers to perform a complete automated review of CTC images for reliable detection of colorectal masses. We hypothesize that the DERALE scheme will be able to detect colorectal masses at a sensitivity comparable to that of unaided expert radiologists and that it can be used to reduce the interpretation time of FR- CADe without degrading diagnostic accuracy in CTC. We will evaluate and compare the classification performance of DERALE with that of unaided expert radiologists and conduct an observer performance study to compare the detection accuracy of the use of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm with that of unaided expert radiologists in the detection of masses from CTC images. Successful development and broad adoption of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm will facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce the mortality rate from colon cancer, one of the largest threats of cancer deaths in the United States. Project Narrative Successful development and validation of DERALE will substantially advance the clinical implementation of CTC and the FR-CADe paradigm in large populations to facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce mortality from colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States.

"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,228951281
"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          n/a",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,8065906,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Benign', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Genetic Programming', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'calcification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,269902,570146095

"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.           7.

"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7665198,"['Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Retrieval', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2008,302577,641965656
"Developing Virtual Colonoscopy for Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Often it is diagnosed at an advanced stage, after the patient has developed symptoms, explaining its high mortality rate. Since most cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated.

"Developing Virtual Colonoscopy for Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Often it is diagnosed at an advanced stage, after the patient has developed symptoms, explaining its high mortality rate. Since most cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated.

"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7677385,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'System', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2009,307479,641965656
"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis.

"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging.

"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis. The proposed technique has significant clinical potentials in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment as well.          n/a",A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis,7841805,"['Algorithms', 'Belief', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'Databases', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal Cell', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'design', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2010,313901,9101010
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,276703803
"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging.

"A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The predominant approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging has been to use automated image analysis to serve as a ""second reader,"" with the aim of improving radiologists' diagnostic performance. CAD techniques traditionally aim to highlight suspicious lesions (called CADe) and/or estimate diagnostic variables, such as probability of malignancy (called CADx). We have been developing and evaluating a different approach to CAD, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will automatically identify and display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated (referred to as the query). This will involve searching a large database for the images that are most similar to the query, based on image features that are automatically extracted by the software. The philosophy of this approach is to help inform the radiologist's diagnosis in difficult cases by presenting relevant information from past cases. The retrieved example lesions will allow the radiologist to explicitly compare known cases to the unknown case. A key advantage of the proposed retrieval approach to CAD is that it leaves decision-making entirely in the hands of the radiologist, unlike CADx, which acts as a supplemental decision maker. In our approach, we aim to tackle the key challenge of image retrieval, which is to develop a meaningful computerized measure of the similarity (relevance) of a patient's images to other images in the database. Departing from typical approaches based on numerical distance measures, we have proposed that the most useful measure of similarity is one that is designed specifically to match that perceived by the radiologist. We postulate that the radiologist's notion of similarity is some complicated unknown function of the images, and use advanced machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. Under R21 funding, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and good performance of our approach in small data sets. The purpose of this proposed R01 project is to follow up the R21 project with a significantly larger scale effort in order to bring this approach to fruition, which will lead to a suite of retrieval-based CAD tools. We will develop the following unique components toward a clinical diagnostic aid: 1) instead of using indexing terms or simple distance measures to identify relevant images in the database, the system will use a similarity measure specifically trained to match radiologists' notion of relevance, as inferred from data obtained in an observer study; 2) in addition to presenting the retrieved cases to the radiologist, the system will use them to boost a CADx classifier to improve its classification accuracy on the query lesion; 3) the system will have the new capability of automatically building a large reference library by extracting known cases from a hospital PACS, thereby maximizing the benefit by retrieving more-similar cases; and 4) the system will be augmented with a highly interactive interface, which will include new tools for automatically adapting the similarity measure according to users' preferences, and for effectively presenting retrieved results. All of these components are novel and important to ultimate success of this kind of diagnostic aid. The project will include a preliminary demonstration using the Hospital Information System at the University of Chicago Hospitals, and will include preliminary evaluation studies to determine the effect of the system on radiologists' diagnostic performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.

"KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DISTRIBUTED CARDIAC IMAGE BASES DESCRIPTION (taken from application abstract):  Heart disease continues          to be the primary cause of death in the U.S., with 25% of all deaths             related to coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition to the loss of             irreplaceable human life, there are also staggering health care costs            and losses in productivity associated with the 1.5 million myocardial            infarctions suffered in the U.S. every year.  The present competing              renewal application seeks to make a contribution toward this vital               health care problem by exploring frontier computing methods to support           and facilitate CAD assessment.

"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis.

Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice.

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,276703803
"DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER BASED TECHNIQUES IN MAMMOGRAPHY The goal of the proposed research is to develop computer-aided diagnosis         (CAD) schemes in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer       in mammography. Four specific aims are included: (l) development of              computer programs for the detection and characterization of                      microcalcifications, (2) development of computer programs for detection          and characterization of masses, (3) implementation of the CAD algorithms         in a dedicated workstation to perform a pilot preclinical testing of the         accuracy of the CAD programs, and (4) evaluation of the effects of the CAD       schemes on radiologists' performance. The proposed CAD schemes will aid          radiologists in screening mammograms for suspicious lesions and provide          estimate of the likelihood of malignancy for the detected lesions. The           information is expected to reduce the miss rate and to improve the               positive predictive value of the mammographic findings.                                                                                                           A data base of clinical mammograms which include malignant and benign            microcalcifications and masses will be established. Physical measures            which characterize the significant image features of the lesions will be         developed. Based on these measures, linear discriminant classifiers or           neural network classifiers will be optimized using a genetic algorithm           approach to classify true and false signals and to estimate the likelihood       of malignancy for each type of lesions.                                                                                                                           For automated detection and classification of microcalcifications, we will       investigate the usefulness of multiresolution analysis for enhancement of        the signal-to-noise ratio of the microcalcifications and for improvement         of feature extraction techniques. Physical characteristics such as size,         shape, frequency spectrum, spatial distribution, clustering properties,          and texture features will be extracted and analyzed with the classifiers.                                                                                         For automated detection and classification of masses, we will improve the        background correction and signal segmentation techniques, and develop            effective false-positive reduction methods. Adaptive filtering, edge             enhancement, and clustering segmentation methods will be developed for           extraction of the mass margins. Physical characteristics such as size,           density, edge sharpness, calcifications, shape, lobulation, spiculation,         and multiresolution wavelet texture features will be extracted from the          masses and analyzed with the classifiers.                                                                                                                         The algorithms will be implemented in a dedicated CAD workstation and            preclinical testing will be conducted. The performance of the programs in        a clinical setting will be assessed. The algorithms will be revised and          improved based on the information obtained with the preclinical testing.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation  SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.            ",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8630169,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,467351,367414121
"Computer-aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%.

"Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on interpretation of DMs. Previous CAD methods for lesion (mass and microcalcification) detection and characterization have been designed for digitized film mammograms and have generally been based on image features extracted from a single view. Our proposed approach is distinctly different from the previous approaches in that image information from two-view mammograms and bilateral mammograms will be fused using machine intelligence techniques. This fundamental change will expand the amount of information utilized in CAD and is expected to improve lesion detection and characterization. New computer vision techniques will be specifically designed for FFDM in order to exploit the advantages offered by digital detectors. This will produce a CAD system that is integrated with and takes full advantage of the latest imaging technologies to further improve the health care of women. We hypothesize that these advanced multiple-image information fusion techniques will lead to a more effective CAD system for FFDMs in comparison to a single-image approach, and that the CAD system will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy in the four most important areas of mammography: (i) detection of masses, (ii) classification of masses, (iii) detection of microcalcifications, and (iv) classification of microcalcifications. A database of digital mammograms (DMs) with malignant and benign lesions and a set of normal cases will be collected. We will first adapt our current film-based CAD algorithms to DMs in each of the four areas, taking into account the differences in the imaging characteristics between DMs and digitized mammograms. New computer vision techniques will then be developed to improve upon the current methods and to exploit the potential advantages of the high contrast sensitivity, high detective quantum efficiency, wide dynamic range, and the linear response to x-ray intensity of digital detectors. Novel regional registration methods for identifying corresponding lesions on CC and MLO views and for comparing the density symmetry on bilateral mammograms will be developed. Innovative fuzzy classification schemes will be designed to fuse multiple-image information and one-view information to reduce false positives and to improve detection sensitivity. Multiple-view morphological and texture features of a lesion will be merged using neural networks or other statistical classifiers for characterization of malignant and benign lesions. To test the hypotheses, we will (1) compare the performance of the multiple-image fusion CAD algorithm for DMs in each area to that of the corresponding one-view algorithm, (2) compare the detection accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies, and (3) compare the classification accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies.

"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10030978,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,504903,340417756

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA.

"Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on interpretation of DMs. Previous CAD methods for lesion (mass and microcalcification) detection and characterization have been designed for digitized film mammograms and have generally been based on image features extracted from a single view. Our proposed approach is distinctly different from the previous approaches in that image information from two-view mammograms and bilateral mammograms will be fused using machine intelligence techniques. This fundamental change will expand the amount of information utilized in CAD and is expected to improve lesion detection and characterization. New computer vision techniques will be specifically designed for FFDM in order to exploit the advantages offered by digital detectors. This will produce a CAD system that is integrated with and takes full advantage of the latest imaging technologies to further improve the health care of women. We hypothesize that these advanced multiple-image information fusion techniques will lead to a more effective CAD system for FFDMs in comparison to a single-image approach, and that the CAD system will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy in the four most important areas of mammography: (i) detection of masses, (ii) classification of masses, (iii) detection of microcalcifications, and (iv) classification of microcalcifications. A database of digital mammograms (DMs) with malignant and benign lesions and a set of normal cases will be collected. We will first adapt our current film-based CAD algorithms to DMs in each of the four areas, taking into account the differences in the imaging characteristics between DMs and digitized mammograms. New computer vision techniques will then be developed to improve upon the current methods and to exploit the potential advantages of the high contrast sensitivity, high detective quantum efficiency, wide dynamic range, and the linear response to x-ray intensity of digital detectors. Novel regional registration methods for identifying corresponding lesions on CC and MLO views and for comparing the density symmetry on bilateral mammograms will be developed. Innovative fuzzy classification schemes will be designed to fuse multiple-image information and one-view information to reduce false positives and to improve detection sensitivity. Multiple-view morphological and texture features of a lesion will be merged using neural networks or other statistical classifiers for characterization of malignant and benign lesions. To test the hypotheses, we will (1) compare the performance of the multiple-image fusion CAD algorithm for DMs in each area to that of the corresponding one-view algorithm, (2) compare the detection accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies, and (3) compare the classification accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies.

"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism Project Summary/Abstract: The US Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism (PE) a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast, colon, and lung cancers. The current diagnostic standard for suspected PE is CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, the number of CTPA examinations is increasing dramatically, and incorrect CTPA interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis). There is a clinical need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PE diagnosis at CTPA. Our central hypothesis is that this clinical need can be addressed by exploiting computer-radiologist synergy. However, existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for PE have serious deficiencies: they are limited in sensitivity and specificity, incapable of handling PE over-diagnosis, and operating only at the embolus level―localizing individual emboli, but PE diagnosis is rendered at the patient-level―excluding non-PE patients and dispatching PE-patients to treatment. Therefore, our objective is to overcome these deficiencies with a new methodology. We have built a strong interdisciplinary team, developed an innovative prototype, and evaluated it through our pilot clinical studies, demonstrating outstanding performance. This proposed research has three specific aims: 1) boost our current system’s embolus-level performance with our newly proposed strategies, assisting radiologists in accurately localizing emboli and facilitating precision medicine through risk stratification; 2) achieve patient-level diagnosis through our newly developed algorithms, assisting radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients and improving diagnostic efficiency; and 3) demonstrate clinical benefits of our system by testing specific clinical hypotheses. This research is innovative because (1) our approach to embolus-level detection fundamentally differs from prior approaches in that it requires no vessel segmentation, overcoming their limitations; (2) we are pioneering two uncharted areas: PE patient-level diagnosis and over-diagnosis prevention; we do not perceive any similar objectives in existing NIH grants or publications in the literature; and (3) this project utilizes our original algorithms and will yield multiple novel algorithms. Our project is significant because it (1) addresses a major national health problem; (2) develops a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention, overcoming the deficiencies of the current PE CAD systems; and (3) delivers a next- generation, high-performance PE CAD system that quickly excludes non-PE patients, accurately localizes emboli, and actively prevent PE over-diagnosis, thereby enhancing radiologists’ diagnostic capabilities and supporting precision medicine through risk stratification. Successful completion of the project is expected because (1) we have already made good progress in algorithm development and clinical evaluation; (2) our approach is carefully crafted on solid algorithmic and mathematical foundations; (3) our clinical evaluation is rigorously designed; and (4) our team is uniquely capable and well prepared to conduct this project, which builds upon our innovative research in CAD, pioneering research in deformable models, and world-renowned PIOPED trials. This research is expected to have important impact on PE- related clinical practice, development of decision support systems for many diseases, and medical education. Project Narrative Behind the great success of biomedical imaging, a crisis is looming: the number of imaging studies is growing exponentially; the workload of radiologists is increasing dramatically; the health-care cost related to imaging is rising rapidly—We are facing a grant new challenge: “image data explosion” (a manifestation of big data in biomedical imaging): Modern imaging systems generate enormous data, far exceeding human abilities for interpretation, but what is paramount are not the images themselves, rather the clinically relevant information contained within the images; therefore, our long-term goal is to develop and validate comprehensive, high-performance computational tools that automatically and quantitatively extract clinically relevant information from images to support clinical decision making and facilitate precision medicine. To demonstrate the immediate, measurable impact of our research, we have chosen pulmonary embolism as our initial research platform because the Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents combined; with laudable efforts to diagnose pulmonary embolism, the number of CT studies for suspected pulmonary embolism has been increasing dramatically, while incorrect CT interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis); therefore, there is a clinical need to (1) mitigate radiologists’ workloads and (2) improve the efficiency and accuracy for pulmonary embolism diagnosis using CT. Our objective is to address this clinical need by exploiting radiologist-computer synergy, delivering two important outcomes: (a) a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention; and (b) a next-generation, high- performance system that will be able to assist radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients without overlooking positive patients, accurately localizing individual emboli to support personalized treatments through risk stratification, and actively preventing PE over-diagnosis, exerting an important positive impact on clinical practice associated with pulmonary embolism—a life-threatening condition.",Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism,9741795,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embolism', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'General Practices', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Impacts', 'Solid', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traffic accidents', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Visualization software', 'Workload', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'synergism', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,586687,51931732
"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8797337,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,596707,367414121
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,90419233
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,641965656
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,9972330,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,628053,276703803

Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,90419233
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice.  The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM.  The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading.  We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project. If we are successful in achieving our aims, we will have a practical solution to the MC detection problems in DBT. We will produce an MC-enhanced and CAD-assisted reading protocol that will serve as a model for DBT system and workstation design. This will pave the way for the acceptance of DBT for clinical use, thereby improving the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening which will benefit all women.",Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis,8108142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modality', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital models', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2011,672019,641965656

Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,90419233
"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. The potential impact is significant given that increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% could positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year in the US alone. Thus, our team is developing an X-ray angiographic analysis system (DeepAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. In Phase I, the PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms was used to build our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model. We achieved a 0.89 Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic (AUROC) for identifying obstructive CAD in images with expert scored ground truth (exceeding our proposed Phase I milestone of >0.85 AUROC). Now in Phase II, we present an innovative image learning pipeline to incorporate anatomical and spatiotemporal information from video sequences (similar to a cardiologist reader). A full end to end X-ray angiography video processing pipeline will be developed and tested in a new cohort of 10,000 patient angiograms with normal and graded abnormal CAD. Our patch-based frame analysis model will advance to CNN full frame-based classification of angiographic views (left heart vs. right heart) and segmentation of coronary vessels (LAD, LCx, and RCA). A multiple frame analysis approach enabled by a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) will equip our model with dynamic temporal information to estimate lesion presence accurately. Our goal for Phase II is to improve reading specificity and translate our Phase I proof of concept research findings into a clinically meaningful tool. A multi-reader, multi-case evaluation by a group of interventional cardiologists interpreting with and without DeepAngio predictions will assess clinical usability to improve coronary stenosis estimation. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with DeepAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we will develop DeepAngio, a novel computer-assistive technology to enhance cardiologist’s angiographic reading process. It is our hope that this technology will increase the accuracy of diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning,10000961,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Aid', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary lesion', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'group intervention', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recursive neural network', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,702450,951823
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,90419233
"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,8894636

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,294146927

"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,8894636
"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories.

"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation.

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,90419233
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,820709

"A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysp, dklasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop a based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for identification of regions at risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the esophagus. EAC is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%; yet the standard of care for detecting precursors to EAC is widely recognized to be inadequate. Just recently, a study found that 25% of patients who underwent a standard endoscopic surveillance exam which was found to be ‘clear’ then went on and progressed to EAC within one year. Clearly today’s approach is not working and a significant percentage of disease is being missed. While comprehensive esophageal OCT imaging has shown great potential in addressing this unmet clinical need, one of the main limiters to wider adoption and impact of this technology is the challenge of interpreting the large volume of high-resolution images in real-time. A CAD algorithm would allow OCT to realize its promise in this field and significantly improve the standard of care. Here we propose the development of a deep learning CAD algorithm which will operate on a full patient level volumetric dataset with awareness of the anatomy, robust against image quality and motion artifacts, and trained and validated against a large dataset (>1000 patients). We will aim to go above the performance threshold set by the American Society for Gastroenterology (ASGE) for the performance of advanced imaging in the detection of high grade dysplasia in BE, and include low grade dysplasia while maintaining a Sensitivity and Specificity of 90/80%. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for use with the NinePoint Medical OCT imaging system and provide early detection of pre-cancerous lesions. Earlier detection leads to earlier treatment, more positive health outcomes for patients and lower healthcare system costs.","A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysp, dklasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus",10010407,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Awareness', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Diseases', 'Esophageal Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Esophagus', 'Feedback', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'case-based', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnosis quality', 'effective therapy', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'validation studies']",NCI,"NINEPOINT MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,852440,852440
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques. The proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on CT scans of 100 patients with coronary artery disease and using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.",Cardiac CT Deblooming,9943684,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Calcium', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'calcification', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic catheterization', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'restenosis', 'simulation', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual', 'virtual reality simulation']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,900092,9617133
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,135941803

"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,9617133
