"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,2021,93342,570146095
"Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT). The three technologies encompass Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity, Deep learning and Intraoperative devices for image guided therapy which will be investigated both individually and in cross TR &D combinations. We will disseminate all technologies through a national network of collaborators, making these discoveries available to the larger medical community.",Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT),10090279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biomedical resource', 'brain surgery', 'cancer care', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'ion mobility', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolic imaging', 'microdevice', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prostate biopsy', 'protocol development', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'technology research and development', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool', 'trait', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,2021,1527478,327644200
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,2021,360227,169622494
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,2021,575125,340417756
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences.
