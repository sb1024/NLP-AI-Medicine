"Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal aims to employ the recent advancement of coupling fiberoptic endoscopes with high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) systems to obtain HSV recordings during connected speech. The goal is to study vocal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. The long-term goal of this line of research is to create clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional measurement of vocal fold vibration in connected speech using innovative laryngeal imaging, an approach that could advance clinical voice assessment and treatment practice. In Aim 1, HSV-based measures of vocal fold kinematics will be developed and the influence of these measures on voice audio-perceptual qualities in the patients will be determined. Image processing techniques will be developed to extract such measures from the HSV data in connected speech. The extracted measures will be given as inputs to the statistical models to determine the source of the differences between the normal controls and the patients for different speech phonetic contexts and words. This aim provides an unbiased HSV-based method to predict voice quality. Developing such HSV-based methodology for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech can enhance clinical voice assessment. In addition, better understanding the influence of phonetic context would lead to optimizing the protocols for functional voice assessment through laryngeal imaging in connected speech. In Aim 2, machine learning approaches will be employed to discover hidden physics and unknown laryngeal mechanisms of voice production in the dysphonic patients. The findings of this project will help make necessary adjustments in biomechanical or physiological characteristics of vocal folds to enhance voice quality in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. Therefore, the outcome of this research will aid clinicians in properly selecting, and developing new treatment strategies (therapeutic, medicinal, or surgical), which are based on the gained knowledge of laryngeal mechanisms of dysphonia. The proposed research is in harmony with multiple priority areas of the NIDCD, described in the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. Both aims support Priority 3 (improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention) through developing objective HSV-based measures and predicting the voice quality. Comparing laryngeal mechanisms in normal and disordered voices addresses Priority 1 (deepen our understanding of the normal function of the systems of human communication). Both aims propose to study laryngeal mechanisms in patients with neurogenic and functional voice disorders, which addresses Priority 2 (increase our knowledge about conditions that alter or diminish communication and health). Project Narrative  The goal of this proposal is to determine laryngeal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in connected speech, which will lead to development of clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech using laryngeal imaging. This can potentially result in enhancement of clinical voice assessment and development of new clinical voice management strategies to better help people with voice disorders.",Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech,10134315,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysphonia', 'Endoscopes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Voice Disturbances', 'Voice Quality', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'sex', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration', 'vocal cord', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,2021,137795,89938253
"Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is critical for planning, treatment, and research referral, but demands time and expertise often unavailable to primary care providers. Speech and language are often impaired early in the disease course of several NCDs. Previous research has demonstrated the diagnostic potential of computer speech analysis (CSA), with differences between healthy controls and disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are several additional steps that must be taken to make CSA a diagnostically viable screening tool. This proposal includes a career development plan providing the applicant with training, mentorship, and experience in the following areas in order to bring CSA techniques into clinical practice: 1) computational linguistics and paralinguistics, 2) longitudinal markers of disease, and 3) design of novel technology for dissemination. As part of this training, academic and professional skills, including ethics in research, will also be expanded. Uniquely qualified mentorship and advisory teams have been selected to ensure the success of the proposed training and research. The proposed study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort investigation of two distinct research groups. The first group is a highly selected and well-characterized research cohort of healthy control, Alzheimer's disease, and MCI subjects (Group A). In Group A, the performance and reproducibility of a machine learning algorithm will be improved to distinguish Alzheimer's disease and MCI from healthy controls using CSA. Multiple regression and voxel-based morphometry will be used to better understand what may drive group differences in CSA measures in Group A as well. Clinical applications of this algorithm will then be assessed in a clinic-based cohort of patients with different NCDs (Group B) in order reduce spectrum bias likely present in prior studies. As sub-aims in both groups, possible further improvement of the algorithmic outcomes with longitudinal CSA measures will also be examined. The overall objective is to develop intuitive, reliable and reproducible CSA-based clinical measures by correlating them with established neuropsychiatric and imaging markers, determining their efficacy in clinical populations, and determining how they change over time. As a result, this research will validate specific speech traits as useful diagnostic markers of neurocognitive disease and explain why those markers differ between patient groups, both of which are major steps towards the design of novel and easily implemented tools in the screening of NCDs such as Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computational speech analysis (CSA) has shown promise as a cost-effective, rapid screening for patients with neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) by objectively and automatically quantifying speech and language use; however, critical steps must be taken before these measures can become clinically useful. I have training and experience in the neurology of speech and language, but require additional training in computational linguistics and paralinguistics, longitudinal markers of disease including neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures, and design of novel technology for dissemination in order to bring CSA into clinical practice. In this project, we propose to investigate the utility of using CSA measures in two distinct patient groups, including a highly characterized group of research participants that includes healthy controls, Alzheimer's disease patients, and mild cognitive impairment patients (Group A), and a group of consented clinic patients with different NCDs (Group B) and to follow these two groups in prospective, longitudinal studies to correlate spontaneous speech measures with standardized linguistic, neuropsychological, and biological measures.",Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders,10145566,"['Accent', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rapid screening', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,2021,188298,292134808
"A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech PROJECT SUMMARY  Oral cancers have the seventh highest incidence, with roughly 51,540 new cases and 10,030 cancer- related deaths expected to occur in 2018. Although a variety of treatment methods are available, the death rate is higher than that for most cancers with five-year rates of about 50 percent. The most frequently used treatment method, glossectomy surgery, involves the surgical removal of tumors and surrounding tissues, and the addition of grafted tissues, often followed by radiotherapy. Although tongue cancer and its treatment have debilitating effects on speech, the impact of varying degrees of resection and reconstruction on the formation of functional units in speech has remained poorly understood. In order to produce intelligible speech, a variety of local muscle groupings of the tongue—i.e., functional units—emerge and recede rapidly and nimbly in a highly coordinated fashion. Therefore, understanding the formation of functional units that are critical for speech production can provide substantial insights into normal, pathological, and adapted motor control strategies in controls and patients with tongue cancer for novel therapeutic, surgical, and rehabilitative strategies. One of the critical challenges in pre-operative surgical and treatment planning, as well as in post- operative evaluation for tongue cancer is the difficulty in developing objective and quantitative measures and in evaluating their functional outcome predictability. To address this, in this proposal, three integrated approaches will be used in in vivo tongue motion during speech to seamlessly identify the functional units and associated quantitative measures: multimodal MRI methods, multimodal deep learning, and biomechanical simulations. This will provide a convergent approach, thereby allowing us to (1) test hypotheses about the spatiotemporal basis of muscle coordination in a consilient way, and (2) develop objective quantitative measures that are required for understanding the complex biomechanical system as well as for predicting the functional outcomes after various reconstruction methods. The first proof of concept study published by the PI and the team identified the functional units of speech tasks using the sparse non-negative matrix factorization framework, in which the magnitude and angle of displacements from tagged MRI were used as our input quantities. With these advances in place, we will further incorporate muscle fiber anatomy from diffusion MRI and motion tracking from tagged MRI into our framework to yield physiologically and anatomically meaningful functional units. In addition, we will create a completely novel and integrated way of directly relating the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy, learning joint representation via a multimodal deep learning technique, and linking them to biomechanical simulations. Furthermore, 3D and 4D atlases will be utilized to identify objective and quantitative measures based on our functional units analysis. Taken together, the successful implementation of our integrated framework will identify functional units that can be used for research on tongue motion, for surgical planning, and for diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation in a range of speech-related disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Tongue cancer and its treatment affect tongue structure and function, yet little is known about how the changes in tongue structure due to varying degrees of resection and reconstruction affect the formation of functional units of tongue motion during speech. We propose to use novel integrated platform tools to identify functional units seamlessly with unprecedented resolution and precision. Upon success of this proposal, our integrated framework has the potential to aid in an increased understanding of speech motor control strategies in healthy controls and the patient group, thereby benefiting patients through improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitative strategies.",A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech,10147030,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Deglutition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'functional outcomes', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,2021,565453,551214295
