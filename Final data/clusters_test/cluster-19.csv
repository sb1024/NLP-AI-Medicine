"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,10070136,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'support vector machine', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2021,192792,66370127
"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10219741,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Endometrial', 'Endometrium', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Laparoscopy', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'eutopic endometrium', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in situ imaging', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ionization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient subsets', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'reproductive', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'subfertility', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,205035,91740242
"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Publications', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'axonopathy', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000,135644722
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,10145049,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein data bank', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,383330,63611576
"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture. Specifically, we will improve the limit of detection in order to distinguish microbial load at or below 103 CFU/ml ! !",MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library,10116273,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cardiolipins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Glycolipids', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length of Stay', 'Libraries', 'Lipid A', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sterols', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic platform', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'fungus', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lipoteichoic acid', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'point of care', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistant strain', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ward', 'wound']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,463500,230060143
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339,550947887
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,10132358,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein data bank', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,514097,641965656
"Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Within the last decade, we have made great strides in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) risk and progression, however much of the variation remains unexplained. We have achieved significant reductions in the time to diagnosis and we have improved diagnostic sensitivity, however specificity is not ideal. Further, most of the FDA-approved MS-specific immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) focus on the inflammatory disease component in the relapsing phase and have little effect on improving outcomes once a patient enters the progressive phase. The challenge for drug trials is the lack biomarkers to detect and monitor MS progression. The objectives of the current application are: 1. To identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from other central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNSIDDs) and non-CNSIDD controls, and 2. To identify biomarkers of disease activity and biomarkers that distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. We propose a multi-stage analysis of pre-existing and well- defined biological samples from two resources.  Aim 1. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify a metabolic signature discriminating MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls (HCs) in two cohorts. In the 1st cohort, MS patients who are early in their diagnosis (≤ 2 years) and IMT naïve/free will be compared to HCs and other CNSIDD cases. Discriminating metabolites will be tested for replication in a 2nd cohort comparing similarly defined MS patients to HCs and other CNSIDDs, and other autoimmune disease patients. We will determine the direction of the replicating MS- metabolite associations using bidirectional genetic instrumental variable analyses. Aim 2. Identify biochemical features of MS disease activity. We will identify metabolic variation corresponding to disease activity by comparing IMT naïve/free patients within 2 years of diagnosis and with a recent relapse to those who have been in remission for ≥3 months and to HCs using supervised classification in a discovery cohort followed by replication analyses in a 2nd cohort. Aim 3. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate progressive from relapsing MS. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify metabolic patterns associated with MS progression by comparing IMT naïve/free patients with relapsing forms of MS to progressive MS from at a single academic specialty clinic. Aim 4. Identify metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. In this exploratory aim we will identify gene-metabolite (GxM) interactions involving the primary MS risk factor, HLA-DRB1*15:01. The encoded peptide is involved in antigen presentation and effectively binds to many endogenous metabolites, suggesting a mechanism through which autoreactive T cells may be activated. We will conduct GxM analyses in MS-HC matched pairs to identify metabolites associated with MS risk in the context of HLA-DRB1.  At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified and characterized a serum-derived metabolomic signature that discriminates MS from other CNSIDDs and non- CNSIDD controls. We also expect to have identified novel serum markers of MS disease activity and progression, as well as putative metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to modify risk. These results will have an important positive impact by identifying serum-derived biochemical traits that could be used to improve diagnostic specificity in MS. There is also the promise of discerning novel molecular processes underlying MS, which will provide new opportunities for the development and evaluation of novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 900,00 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed, with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatory therapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden, thus there is a critical need for accurate discrimination of MS from non-MS conditions, and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor disease activity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target for identifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls, and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapse activity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.",Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,10197636,"['Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complement', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Financial cost', 'Free Will', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health', 'Inflammatory', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuromyelitis Optica', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'autoreactive T cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medical specialties', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein', 'side effect', 'supervised learning', 'targeted therapy trials', 'trait']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,518973,197030888
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248,91477866
"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R44,2021,802944,2060151
