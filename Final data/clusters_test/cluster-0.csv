"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,10142244,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,51036,593605914
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases. It will also facilitate the translation of basic research findings into clinical studies.",Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data,10372265,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome Scan', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,362539,550947887
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767,2689914
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,508845,193405667
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082,329565273
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822,176988430
"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1466398,560644462
"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development. Project Narrative The proposed study is to conduct a large scale genomic discovery of recurrent pregnancy loss using an integrated and innovative genomics approach and construct an intolerome to guide the evaluation of pregnancy loss in clinic and studies of the human early development.",Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss,10226657,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fathers', 'Fetal Development', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Mothers', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Recurrence', 'Reproductive Health', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene discovery', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'grandparent', 'human pangenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1524247,550947887
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935,607172798
