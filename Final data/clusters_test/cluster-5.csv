"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring. If successful, the results will lead to a breakthrough in the field.",Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration,10090547,"['African American', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Fetal Development', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Specificity', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'abeta deposition', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alpha synuclein', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'blood-based biomarker', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'digital', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder control', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'minimally invasive', 'mutation carrier', 'nano-string', 'neuropathology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prenatal testing', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,125096,533594881
"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,"['21 year old', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data de-identification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'response']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R03,2021,157708,0
"Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a public health epidemic, laying an enormous mental, physical, and financial burden on individuals, families, and societies. Despite significant research efforts around the world, the specific link between cognitive / functional deficits and the underlying pathology remains unclear. Critical to solving this is the evaluation of novel cognitive tests within cohorts that have detailed biomarkers for AD pathophysiology. Widely used cognitive tests for AD focus on episodic memory deficits, but recent work led by us and others indicates that tests of spatial navigation and orientation may provide significantly more accurate detection of the earliest signatures of AD. Our hypothesis is that integrating tests of navigation and orientation (to people, places, and events) into one test will prove particularly sensitive. Currently no such test exists.  Our aim is to develop and evaluate a novel ecologically valid cognitive test which probes both navigation and orientation in order to assess cognitively normal older adults (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD dementia participants from two ongoing imaging studies (R01 AG053184 and R01 AG067021) of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Gad Marshall. Participants will undergo amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as part of those studies, which we will leverage in relating those biomarker findings to our novel cognitive test across the early AD continuum. Creating the new test will require combining the expertise of Co-PI Dr. Hugo Spiers (expert in spatial navigation) and Co-PI Dr. Shahar Arzy (expert in orientation). Dr. Spiers has recently developed a virtual reality (VR)-based assessment tool for smartphone and tablet devices that has tested 4.3 million participants on their navigation ability. While this enables an unparalleled opportunity for machine learning to detect subtle impairments, the task is not tailored to the individual’s personal world, which clinical experience as well as research from the Co-PI, Dr. Arzy, indicate to be critical in AD. We therefore propose to develop a novel patient-tailored digital personalized tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of early- stage AD. Building on our recent work, Google Street View (GSV) images will be used to display and enable navigation of the participant’s familiar environment. Overlaid text messages will pop up to provide information about the overriding cover-story and to test navigation and orientation. We will benchmark how hard each person’s environment is to navigate using reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on the local street networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to understand the brain networks engaged by the new task and allow a comparison with the pathological and clinical data collected by Dr. Marshall. Machine learning models will be used to detect subtle impairment in the individual participant level. Following Dr. Spiers’ success in mass appeal and the access to advanced machine learning analyses, the project will enable precision personalized diagnostics of people at the earliest symptomatic stages of AD, and later on, a digital tool to conveniently follow patients over time. Project Narrative  The development of a new digital diagnostic test for the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is ecologically valid is of great importance. In the process, we will gain a new understanding of how people orient and navigate in familiar places and social networks and obtain a more detailed understanding of the changes in the brain that take place in AD in relation to the main problems that occur early in the disease. Finally, new insights into the brain dynamics involved in navigating space and social networks will be gained.",Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease,10126352,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhoods', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Space Perception', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'digital', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'social', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'way finding', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,190054,327644200
"Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed. Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe. Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,10130638,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880,551214295
"Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, resulting in profound dementia. AD is the most common late-onset dementia affecting millions of people in the developed countries of the world and the AD population predicted to reach 130 million by 2050. There has been a concerted effort to identify the mechanism of disease, development of models and therapeutics. In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the observations of uncontrolled chronic inflammatory pathology in the CNS and genetic associations of immune pathways have implicated the microglia. The microglia are the key immune cells in the CNS which provide immunesurveillance, secrete inflammatory molecules, and clear cell debris from the extracellular space. In AD, there is an uncoupling of microglial activation and phagocytosis functions suggesting that these cells are targets for AD drug discovery. Recently, human iPS-derived microglia (iMGLs) models have started to become available. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput, high content functional suite of AD iMGLs assays with the Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system. These assays will allow for a next-generation in vitro system for ranking the relative efficacy of AD microglial based therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is among the disorders that represents an underserved area for drug discovery and development. As a result, the successful development of a low-cost, high-performance technology for predicting the efficacy of drugs on human microglia, an important immune cell type in the brain, would help improve the development process for new AD therapies. Therefore, the goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput human microglial assay suite using Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system.",Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening,10156247,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clear Cell', 'Client', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Extracellular Space', 'Fingerprint', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'In Vitro', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-4', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory Loss', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'System', 'TNFSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mutant', 'neuroinflammation', 'next generation', 'pathogen', 'screening', 'synaptic pruning', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'uptake']",NIA,"PHENOVISTA BIOSCIENCES, LLC",R43,2021,249900,790444
"Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports ABSTRACT Automated medical image classification has seen enormous performance improvements recently, particularly in radiology. The application of these approaches to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), however, has been limited due to relatively small datasets and the limited granularity of their corresponding phenotypes. The dataset size issue is problematic as the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved such remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. Furthermore, the phenotype granularity issue impedes the targeted studying of AD along the lines of what is seen in the “precision medicine” approaches to diseases such as cancer. Solutions exist, however, as an increasingly accepted means of acquiring large amounts of labeled data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image If a radiology report describes a patient's AD-related finding, the associated image(s) can be used to train an image classifier. The parent project to this supplemental proposal (R21EB029575) proposes just such a NLP method while simultaneously solving the granularity issue by extracting fine-grained spatial information from the report. In the parent project, we are developing NLP resources and methods to improve the automated labeling of radiology images using the corresponding study reports. The parent is not specific to AD (or any disease), so this supplement will enable us to focus on this particularly important disease, which will benefit significantly from improved ML-based imaging. We will focus on MRI and PET scans. The Aims here parallel the parent project, each focusing on methods that specifically improve NLP for AD radiological indicator extraction as well as the validation of image classification from the corresponding labels. These Aims include (1) extending the spatial representation and corpus for Alzheimer's, (2) extending the NLP methods for automatic extraction, and (3) validating the AD-related labels for use in image classification. The long-term impact of this project is to substantially improve AD diagnosis by scaling up the amount of labeled data available to ML-based classifiers. The short-term goal supplement is to focus our NLP/Imaging combination research on the complex task of improving AD diagnosis. By extending our project with a specific target for AD, we will initiate a sizable research effort toward this goal. NARRATIVE This project proposes natural language processing methods for automatically extracting fine-grained spatial information—specifically related to Alzheimer's disease—from radiology reports. This will allow us to automatically annotate the image(s) associated with the report for scaling up the amount of training data available to enable state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to better detect Alzheimer's.",Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports,10288320,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Text', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'parent project', 'precision medicine', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,269607,135644722
"CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics Synaptic dysfunction has been hypothesized to be one of the earliest brain changes in Alzheimer’s  disease (AD), leading to hyper-excitation in neuronal circuits. However, network changes related to age  and sex tend to overlap with disease neuropathology, increasing the difficulty of separating  disease-specific alterations from those related to normal aging trajectories in males and females. Indeed,  AD disproportionately affects women, who comprise two thirds of all persons diagnosed with AD dementia.  Leveraging resting state fMRI connectome and diffusion MRI-derived structural connectome, we will use a  novel hybrid resting-state structural connectome (rs-SC) to study excitation-inhibition balance. Recently,  using a group of cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers and age/gender matched non-carriers we  demonstrated a sex-by-age-by-phenotype interaction, with significant hyperexcitation with increasing age  only observable in women, but not in men. Further, hyperexcitation in female carriers began to exhibit at  age 50 in the anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal lobe regions, and the degree of  hyperexcitation is linked to compensatory recruitment of neuronal resources during a spatial learning  memory task.  In this proposal, we will characterize 1) sex-specific normative trajectories of excitation-inhibition balance  using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, and 2) altered excitation-inhibition balance in  abnormal aging using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, as well as 3) further  test and validate our hyperexcitation framework in longitudinal mouse models of AD. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In this proposal, we will develop novel computational tools to characterize hyper-excitation patterns in  aging and Alzheimer's Disease and validate our hyperexcitation framework on human data (ADNI and  HCP) as well as longitudinal mouse models of AD. This will significantly improve our understanding of AD  and potentially accelerate the discovery of more robust non-invasive imaging biomarkers of AD. n/a",CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics,10222567,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anterior', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Knock-in', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Property', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Woman', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease classification', 'ferrite', 'genetic risk factor', 'human data', 'improved', 'lens', 'male', 'men', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropathology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'recruit', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,288746,570146095
"Multivariate methods for identifying multi-task/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers ABSTRACT: The focus of this supplement request is to leverage and reinforce our ongoing biomarker identification work with methods specifically focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD). Deep learning methods that we are developing in the parent grant can produce an optimal performance based on learning end-to-end directly from the data. Our goal is to leverage models trained to classify AD from the full brain fMRI dynamics for capturing novel dynamic biomarkers of AD via trained model introspection. However, it is notoriously difficult to train models to predict directly from full brain dynamics without prior dimensionality reduction. To overcome this difficulty, we will develop self-supervised approaches that would take advantage of unrelated datasets and provide a performance boost that would allow obtaining reliable classification improvements even on small data. This improved classification directly transfers into more reliable introspection of why the model classifies subjects to AD. We plan to improve the robustness of these predictive/introspective methods and study these full-brain fMRI dynamic measures in younger adults who have CSF risk markers assessed for AD in order to evaluate the potential for leveraging such models as biomarkers of AD.

"Examine the risk of Alzheimer's disease in sexual and gender minorities ABSTRACT Although there is an increasing amount of research on the unique health issues that sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals face, prior studies on SGM health are still limited and have primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. In particular, few SGM studies have examined age-related chronic conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the 2nd and 6th leading causes of death for Americans, respectively. Despite both being associated with aging, cancer and AD do not often occur together; nevertheless, they share a number of common risk factors such as obesity, especially social & behavioral determinants of health (SDoH & BDoH) that are more prevalent among SGMs. Considering that SGMs have different health risk profiles compared to non-SGMs, it is crucial that we examine how these two groups differ in cancer and AD risks and the associated risk factors for early prevention and better clinical prognostication. The proliferation of large clinical research networks (CRNs) of real-world data (RWD) including electronic health records (EHRs), claims, and billing data among others, offer unique opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) that will have direct translational impacts on cancer and AD prevention and care in SGM populations.  In our parent award R21 CA245858-01A1, we proposed to: (1) develop computable phenotype (CP) algorithms to identify transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals (a subgroup of SGM) using RWD from OneFlorida—a large clinical data network covering 15 millions of Floridians as well as develop a NLP pipeline to extract cancer-related risk factors, and (2) conduct a population-based cohort analysis to estimate and compare cancer incidence and cancer risk factors between TGNC and non-TGNC individuals.  In this administrative supplement, we propose to (1) extend the TGNC CP to include sexual orientations (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual among others), and (2) conduct a retrospective study to examine whether SGMs and non-SGMs differ in cancer and AD risk, separately. Our aims are to: (1) develop phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify SGM individuals and extract risk factors associated with cancer and AD, leveraging both structured and unstructured EHR data; and (2) estimate and compare the cancer and AD incidences and risk factors in SGM versus non-SGM individuals. This admin supplement will (1) fill a gap as no population-based studies on SGMs’ cancer and AD risks exist; (2) create a large SGM cohort that can be tracked longitudinally by virtue of routine care, and (3) fill a critical gap in our understanding of SGMs’ risks and risk factors at the intersection of cancer and AD—setting the stage for our future studies on identifying the appropriate prevention strategies intersecting cancer and AD (e.g., whether certain cancer screening is adequate for SGMs with early signs of cognitive impairment and a high-risk of AD). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of Alzheimer’s’ disease (AD) and cancer burden and their risk factors in sexual and gender minority (SGM) people. Computable phenotypes that can accurately identify SGM cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor SGM health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as AD and cancer.

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,10167595,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384934,533594881
"Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease Project Summary/Abstract Dementia represents one of the most important public health concerns in the coming decades. Among the most important research goals will be to identify the earliest, most reliable and easily obtainable biomarkers of degeneration, because early identification of individuals most likely to decline now represents the most promising window for therapeutic interventions. The main objective of this project is to develop an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) screening solution based completely on a smartphone application that converts the phone’s facial recognition IR camera into a mobile pupillometer. Our scientific premise, demonstrated by our recent clinical findings, is that pupillary responses provide a biomarker of cognitive effort required to perform tasks before overt performance declines are manifest. Pupil size during cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span recall) increases in response to increased demands, is inversely related to cognitive ability (individuals with lower ability show greater dilation/compensatory effort), and pupil size decreases and performance declines when task demands exceed abilities and compensatory capacity. Someone requiring more effort to achieve the same score as another person is likely to be closer to maximum compensatory capacity and, therefore, at higher risk for decline. We have found that individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk for AD, show greater dilation (effort) on the digit span task, and that greater dilation is associated with greater polygenic risk for AD and neuroimaging indicators of locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction. This is important because pupillary responses reflect LC functioning, and postmortem studies implicate the LC as an early site of AD pathogenesis and degenerative changes with disease progression. Thus, pupillary responses may serve as a specific biomarker of functional alterations in a brain system affected by the earliest manifestations of AD. Currently, pupillary responses can be measured in as little as 5 minutes using minimally invasive, but expensive and complicated office-based devices. To increase the scalability of pupillometry screening in AD, we propose to develop a smartphone assessment that older adults can administer themselves at home that tracks small changes in pupil dilation during cognitive tasks. We will further develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms that use the pupillary response biomarker measured by the phone to perform automated risk assessment of severity of mild cognitive impairment at the early stages of AD. Because the project would be carried out in the context of a larger NIA-funded RF1 affiliated with the UC San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), it will be possible to validate mobile pupillometry assessments against gold-standard in-lab pupillometry in older adults with MCI, early AD, and healthy controls. Our translational goal is to provide access to low-cost at-home screening for people who are potentially at early stages of dementia. In addition, the creation of a low-cost and accurate pupillometer that can be immediately deployed through smartphones will open-up new opportunities for large scale cognition studies that require measurement of pupillary response frequently in daily life settings. Project Narrative Recent research has shown that pupillary responses, an index of how much cognitive effort is needed to perform a memory task, may provide a new biomarker of early risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD); people who have to try harder to perform the task may be closer to cognitive decline. This project aims to develop a self- administrable pupillometer for older adults that uses a smartphone’s built-in IR camera to record pupillary responses during a digit span memory task, with the goal of enabling a machine learning-based automated assessment of risk for cognitive decline. An automated phone-sensor based early stage AD screening tool has the power to enable broad screening of the population of older adults at low cost at-home, in low-resource clinics, and through community health services.",Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,10214386,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Community Health Services', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mydriasis', 'Older Population', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'specific biomarkers']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,392099,524978793
"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10260514,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention Trial', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'semiparametric', 'software development', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'therapeutic development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375,807432003
"Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that can be characterized by brain imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI explains the structural changes, while PET measures represent plaque deposits in the brain according to the disease progression. The plaque deposition reflects early AD pathophysiology and presumably caused by a decrease in the removal rate of beta-amyloid through the cleaning systems of the brain. Recent studies have suggested the potential role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in carrying waste from brain tissue to the cleaning system. However, it is still not well understood how CSF flow in the brain affects waste removal. Therefore, the proposed multidisciplinary research project will involve the collaboration of investigators from diverse and complementary backgrounds (a biomechanical engineer, an MR physicist, a neuroradiologist, and cognitive neuroscientists) to address CSF flow-related AD pathophysiology. To analyze CSF flow in the narrow space between the skull and brain tissue (subarachnoid space [SAS]), we will employ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technique and correlate CSF flow with neuroimaging markers measured by MRI and PET. Here, the overarching hypothesis is, “Disturbed CSF flow in the SAS leads to the deposition of Amyloid plaque.” To test the hypothesis, we will take the following two steps: 1) Fifty healthy older adults will be recruited for an MRI scan. Based on anatomical and CSF velocity information measured by MRI, three-dimensional flow dynamic properties in SAS will be analyzed through CFD simulation, 2) The simulated CSF properties will be correlated with local amyloid plaque deposition by taking advantage of PET imaging data from the NIH-funded parent study (Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center). Here, we will propose a new imaging marker for amyloid removal for each functional brain region by combining imaging, CFD, and clinical measures. As an alternative approach, in case the new imaging markers are not useful in healthy older adults due to the small sample size, we will apply the CFD model to larger datasets for early AD adults. At the completion of this project, a new imaging tool to quantify CSF flow in the SAS and evaluate its effects on amyloid deposition and removal will be proposed. AD pathophysiology at an early stage in older adults can be analyzed using the proposed approach. Ultimately, this project will provide a biomechanical framework for the design and test of interventional and surgical procedures for the treatment of AD. The developed software programs and imaging protocols will be shared through a public software development/sharing platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which involves structural changes as well as plaque deposits in the brain. In this research, we will develop a novel way to analyze the risk of plaque deposition and test its clinical utility. Our research will provide additional scientific insights into AD pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of neurological diseases at an earlier stage and their monitoring over time.",Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease,10196303,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abeta clearance', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Fissural', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meningeal', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Pontine structure', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Subarachnoid Space', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Velocimetries', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging brain', 'arachnoid villi', 'base', 'biomechanical engineering', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cisterna magna', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'design', 'forest', 'glymphatic system', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'lymphatic vessel', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'population based', 'pressure', 'programs', 'recruit', 'segmentation algorithm', 'serial imaging', 'sharing platform', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,426250,134382703
"NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts millions of Americans, yet no effective treatments exist. Iron has been shown to be involved in key AD pathologic processes, including amyloid and tau aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death mechanisms. Despite this growing evidence, it is challenging to ascertain alterations in iron metabolism in vivo, limiting potential translation to biomarkers and novel therapies. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles shed by cells to transport proteins, nucleic acids, metals, lipids or metabolites. While exosomes reflect cellular processes and can reveal disease-related pathologies in human tissues and biofluids, iron abnormalities in AD exosomes have not yet been investigated. We will address this knowledge gap through state-of-the-art exosome isolation technology combined with advanced iron imaging, protein quantification and next generation sequencing methods. Our goal is to investigate iron dysregulation in exosomes from post- mortem AD brains, in order to unveil AD-specific biomarkers and facilitate the development of novel therapies.  The project aims are: (1) To determine whether the quantity, oxidation state, and cellular origin of exosomal iron is altered in AD. Using MRI and synchrotron X-ray microscopy, we will quantify tissue iron content and oxidation state in human AD and control hippocampal specimens. We will then use our novel exosome isolation platform, ExoTIC, to isolate exosomes from regions of high hippocampal iron content in the same specimens. Using antibodies that target cell-surface proteins, we will enrich the isolated exosomes based on their cellular origin (e.g. neurons, microglia, etc.). We will quantify exosomal iron content from each cell type using mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and measure exosomal iron oxidation state using electron microscopy. Taken together, we will determine whether iron content and oxidation state are altered in Alzheimer’s exosomes compared to controls, in particular in exosomes originating in microglia, the brain’s immune cells. (2) Detect dysregulation of iron-related proteins and RNAs in AD exosomes. Using Western blotting on the enriched exosomes, we will determine whether levels of proteins that play a role in iron metabolism are altered in AD compared to controls. Because exosomes are generally rich in microRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression, we will use RNA-Seq to determine whether exosomal microRNAs regulating these same iron-related proteins are also altered in AD. Machine learning algorithms will enable the creation of an atlas of microRNAs linking iron, iron-related proteins, and neuropathology, which should provide a deeper understanding of AD biology.  Characterization of exosome content in the AD brain should result in cell-specific signatures of iron dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration. This approach may elucidate novel aspects of AD biology, lead to novel assays to detect early AD, and facilitate a much-needed future therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence and cost, investigations focusing on abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) have yet to yield an efficacious treatment, so alternative mechanisms need to be investigated. Iron dysregulation is widespread in AD yet is difficult to quantify in living humans using existing methods: we propose to investigate iron dysregulation using exosomes, tiny vesicles shed from brain cells that offer unique information on active cellular processes. Using a novel exosome isolation platform integrated with advanced iron imaging and next generation sequencing, we will identify signatures of iron dysregulation associated with brain cells in AD, which can provide novel pharmaceutical targets towards a much-needed future therapy.",NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD,10223789,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Ceruloplasmin', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Ferritin', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pensions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Synchrotrons', 'TFRC gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transferrin', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'X ray microscopy', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'divalent metal', 'effective therapy', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hepcidin', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'iron metabolism', 'iron oxidation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metal transporting protein 1', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oxidation', 'population based', 'specific biomarkers', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,433029,560644462
"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression,10105251,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Energy Supply', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Update', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain metabolism', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'glucose metabolism', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal course', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'rate of change', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'technique development', 'wasting']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,446131,230060143
"Muli-scale Structural Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Neurodegeneration Project Summary/Abstract. Advanced biomarker mapping has led to the current understanding that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an extremely complex neurodegenerative disorder, with substantial heterogeneity in temporal and spatial characteristics of the classical amyloid and tau pathologies and resultant neurodegeneration among patients (as described by the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration, ‘A-T-N’ biological framework that is the new standard for characterizing the neuropathology of AD). This complexity is a major barrier to clinical care and to the development of effective therapies, highlighting the importance of integrated biomarker neuromapping for understanding AD. However, substantial challenges remain in the neuropathologic characterization of patients. Current procedures for mapping the neurodegenerative component (N) of AD are limited in sensitivity to early pathology. Additionally, the specific biomarkers of the amyloid- and tau-based primary AD neuropathologies are only available through relatively invasive and/or expensive positron emission tomography (PET) and lumbar puncture (LP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) procedures in specialized laboratories and clinics. We aim here to advance AD neuropathology mapping on multiple levels: 1) we will implement a novel multi-scale structural mapping (MSSM) MRI procedure for sensitive quantification of the neurodegeneration component of AD; 2) we will use the MSSM procedure to differentially predict amyloid and/or tau positivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, providing a highly accessible method for pathology detection when advanced biomarkers are not available; 3) we will create individualized ‘A-T-N’ brainmaps through the integration of the MSSM metrics with existing PET amyloid and tau data; and 4) we will use MSSM features for the regional prediction of amyloid and tau pathology for use when PET data are not available. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To test the accuracy of a novel MSSM procedure for probabilistic classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as being amyloid “positive” or tau “positive.” Hypothesis 1a (H1a). We hypothesize that MSSM ‘N’ metric can be used with a high level of sensitivity to predict whether an individual is A+ measured via PET using standard thresholds and/or T+ measured via PET using standard thresholds, or both. H1b. MSSM will provide better separation of individuals as N+ vs. N- than conventional MRI-based atrophy measures, validated through concordance with molecular pathology and clinical progression. Aim 2. To utilize the novel MSSM features for synthesis of PET-like maps of AD neuropathologic change. H2a. MSSM features will provide accurate spatial prediction of specific regional neuropathologic changes. Prediction accuracy will be measured against independent in vivo datasets including a subset with autopsy confirmation and regional quantification of plaques, tangles, and neuronal loss. Successful MSSM implementation would greatly advance the ability to screen for early and complex AD neuropathology.

"Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Project Summary Title: Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Summary: While most patients with late life dementia have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there are conditions that overlap or even mimic AD, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to accurate predictions of rate of progression and to effective therapeutics. Examples of these diseases include concomitant TDP-43 pathology, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and microvascular lesions associated with poorly defined white matter lesions. A critical barrier to studying these diseases is that there currently is no reliable premortem biomarker. Here we propose a collaboration with two Alzheimer’s Research Centers to evaluate anatomical signatures of these three conditions, in contrast to AD, in order to enable research into them, and ultimately port back to MRI in order to directly enhance clinical care.  Specifically, we propose to use advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to perform volumetric photographic scanning post mortem (at autopsy), on patients seen at the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center (MADRC). Reconstructing imaging volumes from dissection photographs, which are routinely acquired at brain banks and neuropathology departments, will enable us to correlate neuropathology with macroscopic measurements (e.g., volume and shape of brain structures, cortical thickness) without the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is crucial because diagnostic MRI is not always acquired close to autopsy, or at all, and ex vivo MRI is expensive, technically challenging, and not available at many research sites. Therefore, our technique has the potential of greatly increasing sample sizes, especially with asymptomatic individuals who were not scanned in life, and who would likely manifest the earliest and purest neuropathological changes.  Our tools will combine ML with 3D shape scanning, which is an increasingly inexpensive technology ($1,000 - $10,000 for a scanner), to produce very accurate reconstructions of the brain shape. Moreover, we will also build an “atlas” version of the tool, that replaces 3D scanning by a probabilistic atlas, thus enabling analysis of retrospective data. We will develop the tools in collaboration with a second ADRC, the University of Washington ADRC, which has slice photographs for approximately one thousand cases.  The new tools will be used to closely study a prospective cohort at MADRC, consisting of 200 subjects. We seek to identify neuroimaging signatures of the AD mimics mentioned above, which can be ported to in vivo MRI scanning. Moreover, we will also distribute and maintain the tools as part of our neuroimaging package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be used by research sites around the world to augment neuropathology with macroscopic morphometric measures at little or no cost. Project Narrative There are conditions that overlap or even mimic Alzheimer’s disease, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to effective treatment. Here we propose a collaboration with two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers to build advanced Artificial Intelligence tools that, combined with a 3D shape scanner, convert dissection photographs (routinely acquired by research centers) into 3D datasets. We will use these tools to unravel the connection between brain shape and microscopic diagnosis of AD mimics, and will also distribute them as part of our widespread software package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be freely used by research laboratories around the world.","Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning",10125271,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Photography', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'design', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'heterogenous data', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in-vivo diagnostics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'object shape', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,502096,551214295
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Machine learning (ML) methods have been crucial in detecting the disease and characterizing its progression. Due to the lack of an in vivo “ground truth” diagnosis, ML approaches have typically relied on clinically derived labels and a case-control design in their search for a single imaging pattern that optimally distinguishes between the two groups in the case-control design. However, heterogeneity within clinical labels may degrade performance and interpretability. The goal of this project is to address this limitation and accurately characterize heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. Given that age is a major risk factor for developing dementia, we will characterize healthy aging using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 1. To this end, we propose to develop a novel unsupervised multi-view machine learning tool that can integrate information from multiple imaging modalities (i.e., structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and amyloid and tau sensitive Positron Emission Tomography) in a principled way. This will enable us to define the normal trajectory of age- related changes across all modalities, providing the necessary context to understand AD pathology. We will characterize AD pathology using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 2. To this end, we propose to develop a novel semi-supervised ML framework that integrates multimodal information and derives data-driven disease dimensions. This is achieved by identifying and quantifying at the individual level imaging patterns that capture neuroanatomical and neuropathological alterations. Our approach builds on our extensive prior work on using an advanced, unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, termed orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization, for analyzing neuroimaging data. Importantly, our project leverages two large multimodal datasets, the Knight AD Research Center (ADRC) cohort and AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which sample participants across the continuum of AD making them ideal for investigating heterogeneity of AD pathology using advanced ML techniques. If successful, our approaches could be used for studying any brain disorder and could be readily integrated into personalized medicine strategies in the future when rich, multimodal imaging data collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in hospitals. Project narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Measurements of anatomy derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as measurements abnormal amyloid and tau protein depositions derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are increasingly used in AD research. In this project, we propose to develop advanced machine learning methods that can integrate information from PET and MRI toward characterizing disease heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. This can improve our understanding of the underlying biological causes of the disease, leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis as well as therapeutic innovation by enabling patient stratification for clinical trials.",Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease,10121679,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Enabling Factors', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'community burden', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'quantitative imaging', 'supervised learning', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,535629,533594881
"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,10132962,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'RNA Interference', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'candidate marker', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'disease heterogeneity', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'proteostasis', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,582016,533302350
"Fast and robust deep learning tools for analysis of neuroimaging data of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Interventions at the preclinical and prodromal stages are appealing targets for slowing or halting disease progression. It is desired to achieve accurate prognosis of AD dementia and cognitive decline for people with mild cognitive impairment who have increased risk to develop AD. In order to achieve fast and accurate prognosis of AD dementia based on neuroimaging data, we will develop and validate novel deep learning techniques. Particularly, we will develop unsupervised deep learning methods for segmenting brain images and reconstructing cortical surfaces from structural magnetic resonance imaging data. These fast and accurate image processing methods will be used in conjunction with advanced deep learning methods to build prognosis models of AD dementia and cognitive decline in a time-to-event analysis framework using large-scale imaging datasets. Finally, we will develop and disseminate a user friendly, open source, modular, and extensible software package to improve prognosis of AD dementia. Source code, standalone programs, and web-application interfaces of all the algorithms will be made available on GitHub and NITRC. Our tools will enable real-time neuroimaging data analysis and can find applications in diverse fields, including quantifying brain changes associated with aging and development. Accurate, time cognitive fast, and robust brain image analysis and pattern recognition methods will be developed for real- neuroimaging data analysis and computer aided prognosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and decline.",Fast and robust deep learning tools for analysis of neuroimaging data of Alzheimer's disease,10118758,"['Adopted', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source Code', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'brain tissue', 'cluster computing', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'segmentation algorithm', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,667100,593605914
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive testing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data analysis pipeline', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'sex', 'ultra high resolution']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,727486,193405667
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,10174646,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical center', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,746785,134382703
"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS,10221566,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical risk', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,757923,533594881
"Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimers Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (Amyloid PET) or invasive (Lumbar Punctures, LP) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt disease symptoms present. Our team has developed an approach that uses machine learning and natural language processing combined with advanced acoustic phonetic and lexical-semantic analyses. Preliminary data show promise in identifying AD biomarker status and predicting 2-year cognitive progression. In the proposed study, we leverage our success in collecting CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging and detailed cognitive phenotyping combined with audio-recordings of participants in the Brain Stress, Hypertension and Aging Research Program cohort. This cohort, now in its second year of follow-up, consists of 400 individuals 50 years or older with normal cognition or MCI. We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, and follow-up CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical-semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker positive and negative participants, have better diagnostic performance than traditional cognitive tests (e.g. confrontation naming), and are associated with a longitudinal change in cognition and AD-related biomarkers. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detection of in-vivo AD pathology in the B-SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate longitudinally the association of the derived features with cognitive decline and their ability to reflect changes in AD biomarkers; and 3) using resting state functional MRI, identify the networks in the brain that map to derived lexical semantic and acoustic features with brain connectivity at baseline and during follow-up. This project will provide needed insight into the use of non-invasive digital biomarkers to improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status in AD. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to explore highly complex changes in connected speech in the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the accuracy and diagnostic performance of non-invasive digital biomarkers in detecting and predicting AD biomarker status in individuals with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment.

"Translational big data analytic approaches to advance drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no available cure. Given recent failures of many AD clinical trials, there is an urgent need for developing effective strategies to identify new AD targets for disease modeling and new candidates for drug repurposing and development. We propose here a research project to develop transformative big data analytic approaches in the fields of translational bioinformatics, machine learning and deep learning to advance drug repurposing for AD. Our overarching goal is to develop innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches as well as informatics tools and pipelines that leverage big data in relevant biomedical domains. These big data include large-scale genetic, multi-omics, imaging, cognitive and other phenotypic data from landmark AD studies, functional interaction data among drugs, proteins and diseases, pharmacologic perturbation data, electronic health record data, and MarketScan data. Our proposed computational research is aimed at developing novel translational informatics approaches to analyze various types of molecular, clinical and other relevant data to identify individual drugs or drug combinations with favorable efficacy and toxicity profiles as candidates for repositioning against AD or AD- related dementia (ADRD). To achieve our goal, we have four Aims. Aim 1 is to develop network-based multi- omics data integration methods to identify genes and pathways as novel targets for AD drug repositioning research. Aim 2 is to develop informatics strategies to prioritize and evaluate promising candidate targets via examining their associations with AD biomarkers and phenotypes. Aim 3 is to develop knowledge-driven drug repurposing methods using network reinforcement and drug scoring to identify AD candidate drugs. Aim 4 is to prioritize and evaluate the identified candidate drugs for repurposing against AD/ADRD using pharmacologic perturbation, EHR and MarketScan data. Successful completion of these aims will produce novel translational big data analytic methods and tools to improve our understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, facilitate the identification of novel promising targets and drugs for repurposing, and ultimately have a translational impact on disease treatment and prevention. These advances are fundamental to the NIA NAPA goal of effectively treating or preventing AD/ADRD by 2025. The resulting methods and tools are also expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes.

"Drug repositioning for Alzheimer's disease via genetics, electronic health records, and human iPSC models Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of  dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD. Drug discovery for AD has  suffered significant failures, many at late stage clinical trials, partly due to our poor  understanding of AD pathology and the lack of disease-relevant and human-relevant discovery and  development models. This calls for team efforts with diverse and complementary expertise to tackle  the challenges together, by developing innovative approaches from multiple angles to achieve the  goal of identifying AD drugs.  In this application, we propose three complementary  Specific Aims that together aim to identify  FDA approved drugs with repurpose potential for AD, from distinct but complementary angles that act  synergistically to boost the likelihood of success. AD is a highly heritable disease, with an  estimated heritability of 70%, highlighting the critical role of genetics in understanding  the  disease etiology. Recent genetic studies have identified over 30 loci, enabling us to dissect the  genetic architecture of AD, including the biological processes and cell types involved in disease  etiology. In particular, we aim to dissect the highly polygenic AD etiology into distinct  pathophysiological components to guide drug repurposing,  which is only feasible in recent years  thanks to large scale GWAS and massive genomics data available publicly (Aim 1). In parallel, we  will mine millions of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify drugs that reduce AD risk and  cognitive decline, by developing phenotyping algorithms from EHR for AD related phenotypes (Aim 2).  In addition, we will develop a high­ throughput screening (HTS) gene expression profiling assay and  use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to identify candidate compounds, and will  further test the efficacy of the candidates in both patient-derived iPSC lines and AD mouse models  (Aim 3). The three aims are complementary  and synergistic, in the sense that they independently   tackle the same problem from drastically distinct angles, while findings from one can be served as  validation for others. Altogether, leveraging distinct and complementary  expertise, we expect to  yield bona fide repurposable drugs for AD with orthogonal support. Project Narrative: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD, and drug discovery for AD has suffered significant failures.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease This research project tackles the NIH/NIA grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across 500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging, MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65- 90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages. The goal of this research project is to address the NIH and NIA's grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and/or disease-related aberrant driving behaviors that may signal early warning signs of functional decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even before standard clinical tests do so. Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,10161702,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weather', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'driving behavior', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'older driver', 'older patient', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'visual motor', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1039678,90289199
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations), 200 subjects meeting clinical criteria with negative amyloid PET (EOnonAD) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). EOnonAD participants and controls will also receive [18]FDG PET. All participants are followed annually (controls up to 24 months; impaired participants up to 48 months). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD and EOnonAD and compare to age-matched controls and sex and stage- matched LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. Additionally, we will characterize demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker measures in EOnonAD cases to explore the possible etiologies of cognitive impairment. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow 600 people with EOAD and related disorders in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),10219685,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biomarker development', 'brain tissue', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2021,1072053,232986943
"A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abstract  We propose to combine mass spectrometry and machine learning to address racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. While African Americans have two to three times the incidence rates of AD than people of European Ancestry, they are underrepresented in past and current AD research studies. The lack of representation leads to a weaker understanding of disease progression and poorer diagnostics for this population. The overarching premise, that advances in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease for all Americans will be stymied unless differences among racial groups are considered, is supported by the literature and demonstrated with preliminary data in the application. The aims of this proposal are, therefore, designed to specifically address the need for a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease in minority groups and to increase the diversity of patients that could be correctly diagnosed with serum-based biomarker panels for AD. Successful completion of the proposed research would accomplish several objectives: We would identify optimal feature selection methods for `omics data; generate the best possible plasma biomarker panel for AD in African Americans; and provide a systematic investigation of the extent to which existing MS- `omics studies' accuracy of predicting AD are modulated by the participants' race.

"Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study Project Summary The path to effective treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on disease detection that occurs before it is too late to reverse progression. Amyloid beta (Aß) is the widely accepted ""gold standard"" biomarker of AD and current methods for measuring this biomarker rely on positron emission tomography (PET) scans and/or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These AD biomarker acquisition methods, however, are expensive, invasive, and difficult to scale and reliance on these approaches have exacerbated racial and ethnic disparities in AD research. Digital technologies offer an alternative method for clinical phenotyping that can detect AD-related changes well before the threshold of clinical symptom severity meets diagnostic criteria. Further, digital phenotyping makes possible the identification and validation of digital biomarkers by determining digital indices that correlate highly with more widely-accepted biological biomarkers. Within this context, this application seeks to capitalize on the opportunistic timing of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) middle-aged Generation 3 and Omni Generations 2 cohorts as participants return for their NHLBI-funded 4th health examination. The NHLBI funding, however, only covers costs associated with about 20% of the health exam components. The remaining 80% of the health exam will be determined by ancillary studies such as the project proposed here. This project aims to add two new components to the Gen 3/OmniGen 2 health exam. Aim 1 proposes conducting a novel lens Aβ eye scan that pairs a topically-applied fluorescent Aβ-binding ligand with a specialized spectroscopic eye scanner that can detect Aß deposition in the lens of the eye and has demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity to detect early AD-related Aβ pathology compared to amyloid-PET brain scans. Aim 2 seeks to use a smartphone application to collect 3 years of longitudinal cognitive metrics from which to characterize those with stable cognition versus declining cognition. Proposed analyses across these two aims will test the overall hypothesis that novel digital cognitive profiles that are unique combinations of digital features (e.g., item-specific responses, latencies, error rates, acoustic and linguistic measures) can detect those who are lens Aβ positive and/or at high AD risk (e.g., high cardiovascular risk, ApoE4+, family history of dementia, women, age >60+). Aim 3 will further apply traditional a priori and novel data-driven machine learning computational tools to construct multi-marker profiles that are highly predictive (AUC > .85) of stable cognition and cognitive decline. We posit that machine learning methods will generate more highly predictive models specific to digital cognitive profiles as compared to a priori methods. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to collect a novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker and longitudinal digital cognitive data using a smartphone. Together these data will allow testing the overall hypothesis that it is possible to detect preclinical AD at a much earlier age than previously assumed.",Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study,10214162,"['Acoustics', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Eye', 'Family history of', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Response Latencies', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Topical application', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta deposition', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data resource', 'dementia risk', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'indexing', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'middle age', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2021,1836408,164685352
"Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one the greatest scientiﬁc challenges of our time. There is a growing realization that experimental treatments should target the earliest, presymptomatic stages of disease. But the cost of conducting clinical trials in participants who may not develop symptoms of AD for years can be prohibitive. There is a growing need for more eﬀective biomarkers of AD, particularly biomarkers of therapeutic eﬃcacy that can detect slowing or reversal of AD-related changes due to treatment as early in the clinical trial as possible. These biomarkers must be as sensitive as possible to disease progression and also account for AD heterogeneity, i.e., the fact that the majority of individuals who have AD pathology also have one or more concomitant pathologies that may aﬀect their ability to respond to experimental treatments for AD. This proposal focuses on deriving eﬀective presymptomatic and early symptomatic AD biomarkers from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging modality that provides the most direct evidence of neuritic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. Rather than propose new MRI acquisition protocols, we focus on the most commonly collected type of MRI scan in AD research (T1-weighted 3D gradient echo scans with approximately 1x1x1mm3 resolution) and use advanced computational analysis to quantify changes in the subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the brain region that associated with early stages of AD pathology as well as with early stages of multiple concomitant non-AD pathologies. Aim 1 will develop and validate advanced algorithms that combine conventional multi-atlas segmentation with deep learning to reliably extract small subregions of the MTL, such as Brodmann area 35, explicitly accounting for anatomical variability in the MTL. Aim 2 will correlate quantitative digital pathology measures derived at autopsy with antemortem MRI to discover distinct patterns of change that we hypothesize are associated with concomitant pathologies in AD, including TDP-43 pathology, alpha-synucleinopathy, non-AD tauopathies, and cerebrovascular disease. Aim 3 will apply deep learning to improve the sensitivity of measures of change in longitudinal MRI, hypothetically leading to a more sensitive early marker of treatment eﬀectiveness in trials targeting preclinical AD than existing cognitive and imaging-based measures. Taken together, improved precision of segmentation (Aim 1), determination of spatial patterns of AD and concomitant non-AD pathology (Aim 2), and advanced longitudinal measurement methodology (Aim 3) will optimize MTL subregional sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD, providing a potentially critical therapeutic eﬃcacy measure to accelerate clinical trials of disease modifying treatments in early AD. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely be most eﬀective if applied before patients begin to develop symptoms of cognitive decline. But clinical trials in individuals who do not yet have any symptoms of disease can take a very long time and be very costly. This project uses common magnetic resonance imaging exams and artiﬁcial intelligence tools to detect subtle changes over time in parts of the brain where damage speciﬁcally due to Alzheimer's disease ﬁrst occurs, providing clinical trials with a faster way to determine if treatments are being eﬀective.",Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease,10235472,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer associated neurodegeneration', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computational atlas', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital pathology', 'disease heterogeneity', 'empowered', 'experimental arm', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'pre-clinical', 'protein TDP-43', 'recruit', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'synucleinopathy', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2021,2094490,593605914
"Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers Project Summary Recent estimates indicate that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may rank as the third leading cause of death for older people in the United States, just behind heart disease and cancer. While scientists know that AD involves a progressive brain cell failure, the reason why cells fail is still not clear. To understand the progression of the disease, one of the keys is to investigate the cognitive changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even though biomarkers such as imaging and clinical functions are found to be outstanding in differentiating AD patients from those with normal cognition (NC), studies suggest that their discriminative power in early-stage MCI are rather limited. Detecting signals which distinguish subjects with MCI from those with NC is challenging due to the low sensitivity and high variability of current clinical measures such as annually assessed neuropsychological test results and self-reported functional measurements. Moreover, even though in-vivo biomarkers such as beta-amyloid and tau can be used as indicators of pathological progression towards AD, the screening of biomarkers are prohibitively expensive to be widely used among pre-symptomatic individuals in the outpatient setting. We hypothesize that progressive cognitive impact from MCI has elicited detectable changes in the way people talk and behave, which can be sensed by inexpensive and accessible sensors and leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms to build predictive models for quantifying the risk of MCI. Our preliminary results on a small cohort indicated that there are significant differences between MCI and NC subjects during a semi-structured conversation, and ML algorithms can use such differences for differentiating MCI and NC with promising performance. Our preliminary results in behavior monitoring also suggest highly predictive performance using temporal patterns of behavior signals. In this project, we plan to build upon our initial success and conduct comprehensive studies on language and behavior markers in larger-scale cohorts to build high-performance and interpretable ML models for screening MCI. Our three Specific Aims are: (1) Discover language markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using interview recordings from the I-CONECT project, we will use natural language processing and ML algorithms to extract linguistic and acoustic markers and develop multi- modal learning algorithms to fuse the two types of information. (2) Discover behavior markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using the in-home monitoring data from ORCATECH, we will extract short-term and long-term behavior patterns and integrate multi-granularity behavior markers to differentiate MCI and NC. (3) Linking language and behavior markers with an information framework. We will use demographics and common clinical information to profile the patients and match the two cohorts via certain similarity metrics, creating complementary features for improved prediction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans and leads to progressive memory loss without effective treatments to date. Early and accurate identification of its prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment, are critical for clinical-trial enrichment as well as early intervention of the AD. In this project, we propose to discover cost-effective and user-friendly language and behavior markers signaling MCI and integrating the markers into effective machine learning models for the detection of MCI.",Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers,10212669,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Memory Loss', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Oregon', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'aging and technology', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information framework', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'screening', 'sensor', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'user-friendly', 'walking speed']",NIA,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,2286356,89938253
"Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD Our proposed study focuses on developing deep neural networks and sophisticated multivariate analysis methods for studying episodic memory activations in prodromal AD subjects and age-matched normal controls. We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of spatial and object pattern-separation in subfields of the hippocampus, nearby regions of the medial temporal lobe, and functional whole-brain connections. In order to acquire a fuller understanding of the underlying physiological processes driving AD pathology, activations in hippocampal subfields must be investigated in further depth and with methodologies that exceed the current limitations of fMRI at 3T. Acquiring data that will yield a more accurate view of these hippocampal interactions is far more easily facilitated with 7T technology, although barriers complicate such a study even at 7T. Our proposed study centers on circumventing these barriers, particularly data contamination from excessive system noise, head-motion noise, and physiological noise which is proportional to the field strength, to develop methods that will allow investigators to work within the parameters of 7T at its fullest capacity toward the development of more powerful imaging biomarkers for diagnosing AD. To increase the likelihood of the successful completion of our study, we consider it imperative to develop better task fMRI designs and imaging protocols (Aim 1), automatic segmentation methods (Aim 2), noise-reduction methods (Aim 3), and multivariate analysis methods, such as novel algorithms and software tools based on constrained canonical correlation analysis (constrained CCA), kernel CCA, and deep CCA and relevant group-level analysis using fusion CCA, multiset CCA, and machine learning and deep learning techniques (Aim 4) for studying memory function to obtain novel imaging biomarkers (Aim 5) to identify individuals at risk for AD. This study will enable the creation of clearer and more detailed brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function in prodromal AD. The successful completion of our objectives could lead to more effective diagnostic tools for AD, including an fMRI-based diagnostic test for memory impairment to characterize abnormal memory function in people at risk for AD. Our advanced methodology, combining 7T high-resolution fMRI, automatic segmentation, data denoising and multivariate analysis, will be essential for detecting subtle functional changes in subfields of the hippocampus and its connections to other cortical regions. Results from this study are expected to broadly impact scientific understanding of brain function beyond only enhancing current understanding of memory function in AD. We anticipate that the methods developed from findings acquired in our proposed study will have a far-reaching influence on improving fMRI data quality, enable more accurate detection of brain activation, open a path toward better automated and instantaneous hippocampal subfield segmentation for many other MRI/fMRI applications of neurodegenerative diseases, and contribute new and vital discoveries to the field of neuroscience in general. Project narrative The proposed study is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow for more in-depth analysis of high-resolution fMRI data, in particular, data used in the characterization of brain function, which offers significant potential for more effective diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study will investigate memory activation in the medial temporal lobes with high-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla with multivariate analysis to identify brain dysfunction in prodromal AD. The methods developed from the findings acquired in this study will have a far-reaching influence on MRI/fMRI research in neurodegenerative diseases by improving fMRI data quality, facilitating automated and instantaneous brain segmentation, and more accurately identifying individuals at risk for AD.",Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD,10181265,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elderly', 'Encephalitis', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'data fusion', 'data quality', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'denoising', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'memory process', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,RF1,2021,2331558,110237370
"Facilitate Observational Studies of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias Using Ontology and Natural Language Processing Project Summary As the 6th leading cause of death in the US, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5.7 million Americans. However, up until now, our understanding of risk factors of AD/ADRD is still limited and our efforts on developing effective treatments for AD/ADRD have been greatly disappointing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to conduct AD/ADRD research more efficiently. One of the potential approaches is to leverage large, longitudinal, observational clinical data accumulated in electronic health records (EHRs). Nevertheless, current uses of EHRs for AD/ADRD research is very limited, often requiring manual data extraction and normalization (i.e., manual chart review), which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, we plan to develop novel ontology and natural language processing (NLP) based informatics methods and tools to automatically extract and normalize AD/ADRD-related clinical data in EHRs, thus facilitating efficient AD/ADRD observational studies using EHRs. We propose the following three specific aims to achieve this goal: 1) Build an information model for EHR-based AD/ADRD research using a formal ontology representation approach; and 2) Extract and normalize AD/ADRD information in clinical documents using NLP technologies; and 3) Evaluate developed informatics methods and tools through demonstration studies and disseminate them to support observational AD/ADRD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we propose to develop novel informatics approaches to automatically extract detailed clinical information about Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) patients (e.g., disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and response) from heterogeneous electronic health records databases. This technology will allow more efficient information extraction from patients' records, thus facilitating clinical research on AD/ADRD.",Facilitate Observational Studies of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias Using Ontology and Natural Language Processing,10235325,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Data Store', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospice Care', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Long-Term Care', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'health data', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'information model', 'network informatics', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,RF1,2021,2371994,135644722
"Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 1. SUMMARY (Overall) The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2) develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8) support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia.
