"Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal aims to employ the recent advancement of coupling fiberoptic endoscopes with high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) systems to obtain HSV recordings during connected speech. The goal is to study vocal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. The long-term goal of this line of research is to create clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional measurement of vocal fold vibration in connected speech using innovative laryngeal imaging, an approach that could advance clinical voice assessment and treatment practice. In Aim 1, HSV-based measures of vocal fold kinematics will be developed and the influence of these measures on voice audio-perceptual qualities in the patients will be determined. Image processing techniques will be developed to extract such measures from the HSV data in connected speech. The extracted measures will be given as inputs to the statistical models to determine the source of the differences between the normal controls and the patients for different speech phonetic contexts and words. This aim provides an unbiased HSV-based method to predict voice quality. Developing such HSV-based methodology for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech can enhance clinical voice assessment. In addition, better understanding the influence of phonetic context would lead to optimizing the protocols for functional voice assessment through laryngeal imaging in connected speech. In Aim 2, machine learning approaches will be employed to discover hidden physics and unknown laryngeal mechanisms of voice production in the dysphonic patients. The findings of this project will help make necessary adjustments in biomechanical or physiological characteristics of vocal folds to enhance voice quality in patients with neurogenic voice disorders. Therefore, the outcome of this research will aid clinicians in properly selecting, and developing new treatment strategies (therapeutic, medicinal, or surgical), which are based on the gained knowledge of laryngeal mechanisms of dysphonia. The proposed research is in harmony with multiple priority areas of the NIDCD, described in the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. Both aims support Priority 3 (improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention) through developing objective HSV-based measures and predicting the voice quality. Comparing laryngeal mechanisms in normal and disordered voices addresses Priority 1 (deepen our understanding of the normal function of the systems of human communication). Both aims propose to study laryngeal mechanisms in patients with neurogenic and functional voice disorders, which addresses Priority 2 (increase our knowledge about conditions that alter or diminish communication and health). Project Narrative  The goal of this proposal is to determine laryngeal mechanisms underlying dysphonia in connected speech, which will lead to development of clinically applicable quantitative methods for functional laryngeal examination in connected speech using laryngeal imaging. This can potentially result in enhancement of clinical voice assessment and development of new clinical voice management strategies to better help people with voice disorders.",Studying the Laryngeal Mechanisms Underlying Dysphonia in Connected Speech,10134315,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysphonia', 'Endoscopes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Voice Disturbances', 'Voice Quality', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'sex', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration', 'vocal cord', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,137795,89938253
"Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is critical for planning, treatment, and research referral, but demands time and expertise often unavailable to primary care providers. Speech and language are often impaired early in the disease course of several NCDs. Previous research has demonstrated the diagnostic potential of computer speech analysis (CSA), with differences between healthy controls and disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are several additional steps that must be taken to make CSA a diagnostically viable screening tool. This proposal includes a career development plan providing the applicant with training, mentorship, and experience in the following areas in order to bring CSA techniques into clinical practice: 1) computational linguistics and paralinguistics, 2) longitudinal markers of disease, and 3) design of novel technology for dissemination. As part of this training, academic and professional skills, including ethics in research, will also be expanded. Uniquely qualified mentorship and advisory teams have been selected to ensure the success of the proposed training and research. The proposed study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort investigation of two distinct research groups. The first group is a highly selected and well-characterized research cohort of healthy control, Alzheimer's disease, and MCI subjects (Group A). In Group A, the performance and reproducibility of a machine learning algorithm will be improved to distinguish Alzheimer's disease and MCI from healthy controls using CSA. Multiple regression and voxel-based morphometry will be used to better understand what may drive group differences in CSA measures in Group A as well. Clinical applications of this algorithm will then be assessed in a clinic-based cohort of patients with different NCDs (Group B) in order reduce spectrum bias likely present in prior studies. As sub-aims in both groups, possible further improvement of the algorithmic outcomes with longitudinal CSA measures will also be examined. The overall objective is to develop intuitive, reliable and reproducible CSA-based clinical measures by correlating them with established neuropsychiatric and imaging markers, determining their efficacy in clinical populations, and determining how they change over time. As a result, this research will validate specific speech traits as useful diagnostic markers of neurocognitive disease and explain why those markers differ between patient groups, both of which are major steps towards the design of novel and easily implemented tools in the screening of NCDs such as Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computational speech analysis (CSA) has shown promise as a cost-effective, rapid screening for patients with neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) by objectively and automatically quantifying speech and language use; however, critical steps must be taken before these measures can become clinically useful. I have training and experience in the neurology of speech and language, but require additional training in computational linguistics and paralinguistics, longitudinal markers of disease including neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures, and design of novel technology for dissemination in order to bring CSA into clinical practice. In this project, we propose to investigate the utility of using CSA measures in two distinct patient groups, including a highly characterized group of research participants that includes healthy controls, Alzheimer's disease patients, and mild cognitive impairment patients (Group A), and a group of consented clinic patients with different NCDs (Group B) and to follow these two groups in prospective, longitudinal studies to correlate spontaneous speech measures with standardized linguistic, neuropsychological, and biological measures.",Computational Speech Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurocognitive Disorders,10145566,"['Accent', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rapid screening', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,188298,292134808
"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patients’ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smith’s role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smith’s rigorous training plan includes a Master’s degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patients’ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smith’s proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,10115019,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical movement disorder', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'common symptom', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'large scale data', 'lexical retrieval', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motor deficit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2021,189216,294146927
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportunity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,10190783,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2021,292596,6229561
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,10160864,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,335661,524978793
"A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech PROJECT SUMMARY  Oral cancers have the seventh highest incidence, with roughly 51,540 new cases and 10,030 cancer- related deaths expected to occur in 2018. Although a variety of treatment methods are available, the death rate is higher than that for most cancers with five-year rates of about 50 percent. The most frequently used treatment method, glossectomy surgery, involves the surgical removal of tumors and surrounding tissues, and the addition of grafted tissues, often followed by radiotherapy. Although tongue cancer and its treatment have debilitating effects on speech, the impact of varying degrees of resection and reconstruction on the formation of functional units in speech has remained poorly understood. In order to produce intelligible speech, a variety of local muscle groupings of the tongue—i.e., functional units—emerge and recede rapidly and nimbly in a highly coordinated fashion. Therefore, understanding the formation of functional units that are critical for speech production can provide substantial insights into normal, pathological, and adapted motor control strategies in controls and patients with tongue cancer for novel therapeutic, surgical, and rehabilitative strategies. One of the critical challenges in pre-operative surgical and treatment planning, as well as in post- operative evaluation for tongue cancer is the difficulty in developing objective and quantitative measures and in evaluating their functional outcome predictability. To address this, in this proposal, three integrated approaches will be used in in vivo tongue motion during speech to seamlessly identify the functional units and associated quantitative measures: multimodal MRI methods, multimodal deep learning, and biomechanical simulations. This will provide a convergent approach, thereby allowing us to (1) test hypotheses about the spatiotemporal basis of muscle coordination in a consilient way, and (2) develop objective quantitative measures that are required for understanding the complex biomechanical system as well as for predicting the functional outcomes after various reconstruction methods. The first proof of concept study published by the PI and the team identified the functional units of speech tasks using the sparse non-negative matrix factorization framework, in which the magnitude and angle of displacements from tagged MRI were used as our input quantities. With these advances in place, we will further incorporate muscle fiber anatomy from diffusion MRI and motion tracking from tagged MRI into our framework to yield physiologically and anatomically meaningful functional units. In addition, we will create a completely novel and integrated way of directly relating the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy, learning joint representation via a multimodal deep learning technique, and linking them to biomechanical simulations. Furthermore, 3D and 4D atlases will be utilized to identify objective and quantitative measures based on our functional units analysis. Taken together, the successful implementation of our integrated framework will identify functional units that can be used for research on tongue motion, for surgical planning, and for diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation in a range of speech-related disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Tongue cancer and its treatment affect tongue structure and function, yet little is known about how the changes in tongue structure due to varying degrees of resection and reconstruction affect the formation of functional units of tongue motion during speech. We propose to use novel integrated platform tools to identify functional units seamlessly with unprecedented resolution and precision. Upon success of this proposal, our integrated framework has the potential to aid in an increased understanding of speech motor control strategies in healthy controls and the patient group, thereby benefiting patients through improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitative strategies.",A holistic approach to identifying functional units of tongue motion during speech,10147030,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Deglutition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'functional outcomes', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,565453,551214295
