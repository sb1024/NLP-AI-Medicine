"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects. The results from this study will also provide mechanistic insight into the disease and guide future clinical trials to treat this tumor.",Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas,10231604,"['Adenoviruses', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Astrocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neuraxis', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'efficacy testing', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncolysis', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'preclinical development', 'predicting response', 'protein protein interaction', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small hairpin RNA', 'standard of care', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'viral resistance']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,2021,46236,276703803
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,2021,153920,61807989
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,10137898,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,2021,311975,148186688
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,2021,619994,197030888
