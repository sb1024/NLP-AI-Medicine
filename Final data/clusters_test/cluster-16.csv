"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110,188894159
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated. ADVANCE Kidney Health responds to this need by assembling diverse mentors, interdisciplinary infrastructure and novel engineering technologies to impact career trajectories and develop the new technological cures of tomorrow.",Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health),10230895,"['Active Learning', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Arizona', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Career Mobility', 'Caring', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Thinking', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Hypertension', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internships', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laws', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motivation', 'Nephrology', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem Solving', 'Ramp', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Solid', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Universities', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'career preparation', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'early experience', 'education research', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'graduate student', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'kidney dysfunction', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'product development', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'summer research', 'technology development', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2021,140400,161094826
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail. Successful completion of this project has the potential to identify new markers of disease and novel targets for treatment.",Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection,10152649,"['Advisory Committees', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Arteritis', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Complex', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FYN gene', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'IGFBP3 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'TNFRSF17 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'base', 'belimumab', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'kidney biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'random forest', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,164258,533594881
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444,673201228
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691,558628098
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,10160972,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'axonal sprouting', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,465464,157845771
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198,570146095
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422,601447
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,10105323,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645115,560644462
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,790095,550947887
